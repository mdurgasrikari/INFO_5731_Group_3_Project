The correlation coefficient is a measure of the strength of the linear relationship between two variables. It can range from -1 to 1, where -1 indicates a perfect negative correlation, 0 indicates no correlation, and 1 indicates a perfect positive correlation.

In this case, the correlation matrix shows that there are some strong positive correlations between some of the variables. For example, the correlation between LogDailyInvestors and Twitter is 0.58, which indicates that there is a strong positive relationship between the two variables. This means that as the number of daily investors increases, the number of tweets also increases.

There are also some strong negative correlations between some of the variables. For example, the correlation between LogDailyInvestors and Days Available is -0.53, which indicates that there is a strong negative relationship between the two variables. This means that as the number of days available decreases, the number of daily investors increases.

In the unsuccessful conversations, the chatbot responded twice with textual elements to restart the conversation. In addition, two conversations were short in terms of the length of the conversation itself and KIM?s responses presenting 2 correct recipes, while the other two conversations were long with a lengthy introduction by KIM, and a detailed textual presentation displaying 5?6 recipes (see Figure A1 in the appendix). The experiment was supported by a German market research institute and took place with 627 participants in February 2022. We asked the respondents to read one sample conversation with KIM thoroughly and to evaluate KIM in terms of the conversation ability score and the three item scales (perceived naturalness of KIM, performance of the chat, satisfaction with the interaction). To check manipulation, they were asked to indicate whether KIM made good recipe suggestions and answered straight to the point ? that is, short and concise.

In the usability study (Study 1), the percentage of females was higher (60.2%) than males (39.0%, 0.8% diverse). In the experiment (Study 2), the gender distribution was more balanced with 51.0% females and 47.7% males (1.3% diverse).

The share of respondents under 20 was more than twice the size in Study 2 (14.7% vs. 5.7%) reflecting the aim to include a younger age group. Over time, the claim of familiarity with the term chatbot increased from about two-thirds to three-quarters of the respondents, more often males. In both samples, less than half of the respondents already had experience of chatbot usage. The percentage was higher compared to an earlier study on the acceptance of chatbots (Rese et al., 2020). About two-thirds of the sample in Study 1 use Facebook Messenger, and about half of the sample Study 2. However, the chatbot, KIM, is largely unfamiliar to respondents, in particular in Study 1. With regard to diet preferences, more than half of the respondents follow no special regimen, whilst about a quarter to a third are vegetarians, among them significantly greater numbers of females. Female respondents search for recipes more frequently on the internet in both samples. In general, the time spent searching for a recipe was short. In Study 1, half of the respondents take up to 5 min and another third up to 10 min, whilst in Study 2 about a quarter need longer with up to 20 min and more (see Table 4).

Most participants completed the recipe search, corresponding more or less to their food preferences. Often KIM asked two questions about recipe criteria (48.0%), including the ingredients. In 3.3% of the dialogues, KIM referred to all three criteria, whilst not mentioning them explicitly in 21.1% of the conversations. On average, KIM suggested 6 recipes to the user, of which a small number were inappropriate (18.2%). The search was quick, with KIM posting more messages and using more words. KIM?s messages usually included one emoji per dialogue. KIM had to restart the conversation once in almost every dialogue. This had a significantly greater frequency in dialogues with female users, who also received a lower percentage of correct recipes. In about a quarter of the cases, KIM failed to employ a correct greeting, either repeating the same message or omitting the greeting. In the evaluation by external reviewers, KIM received a mean conversational ability score above 0 = poor, machine-like, but still under 50. This score was termed as ?good conversationalist? and was achieved by 2 of the 6 chatbots evaluated (Shah et al., 2016).

We employed stepwise regression analysis to integrate into the model not only the independent variables concerning the hypotheses but also all available independent variables from Table A1. We chose this more exploratory approach because of the scarcity of research results on the human?chatbot conversation. We used the four internal and external dependent evaluation variables. Similar to the results from the mean comparison, the external evaluation with the conversational ability score and, to some extent, user satisfaction were shown to be suitable and provided higher R2. Taking the external evaluation ? the conversational ability score ? into account, H1b and H7b were confirmed, and a positive effect of a high percentage of correct recipe suggestions (0.212, p = 0.003) and a negative effect of the number of conversation restarts (-0.506, p = 0.000) were established. For user satisfaction, the positive effect of a high percentage of correct recipe suggestions (0.174, p = 0.043) was also found. Other hypotheses on the perceived conversational ability of KIM could not be proven. The internal evaluation criteria established negative effects for the number of messages, the number of words from the user, the number of greetings by KIM, and the number of wrong recipe suggestions. While the presence of a correct greeting did not show the hypothesized positive effect (H8b), additional greetings had a negative effect (Table 7).",0.0,-0.08213441,0.7632694840431213,0.0,0.6875

To investigate conversational ability, we used the task-based and text-based chatbot, KIM, by MAGGI Kochstudio to perform the task of finding an accurate recipe and to undertake an analysis of 123 unstructured chat records (Study 1). An overview of previous studies analysing text-based chatbot conversations supported the identification of relevant features and evaluation variables from usability research (Fr?j? et al., 2000). We focused on several task-based and text-based variables as well as two characteristics of conversational ability that potentially influence the success of KIM in this area. In addition, we relied on an external evaluation by three reviewers based on the conversational ability score (Shah et al., 2016) and a subjective user evaluation following the conversation with KIM using item scales describing user satisfaction (Hornb?, 2006, Shawar and Atwel, 2007, S?erlund, 2022, S?erlund and Oikarinen, 2021). A scenario-based experiment (Study 2) was used to gain further insights into user evaluation of selected conversational elements (see Table 8). The usability study (Study 1) provided insights into several task-based and text features as well as characteristics of conversational ability, and it was used as a source for example dialogues. While chatbot usage could be monitored, the implementation period was rather long with data collected in person.

We assessed the measurement models for the pooled data and then group 1 (U.S.) and group 2 (China). As displayed in Table 3, constructs were internally consistent since Cronbach?s alpha values were > the 0.70 threshold (Nunnally & Bernstein, 1994). The convergent validity criterion was verified, with average variance extracted (AVE) values all above 0.50 (Fornell & Bookstein, 1982).",0.2214958028447875,0.7643973,0.7687166929244995,0.354978354978355,0.7195335445335448

The results show that sunk costs have a significant positive indirect effect on intermittent discontinuance through transition fatigue (path coefficient = 0.062, p < 0.05). Sunk costs also have a significant positive direct effect on intermittent discontinuance (path coefficient = 0.184, p < 0.05). The total effect of sunk costs on intermittent discontinuance is 0.246 (p < 0.05).

Transition costs have a significant positive indirect effect on intermittent discontinuance through transition fatigue (path coefficient = -0.033, p < 0.05). Transition costs also have a significant positive direct effect on intermittent discontinuance (path coefficient = 0.241, p < 0.05). The total effect of transition costs on intermittent discontinuance is 0.208 (p < 0.05).

The results of the mediation analysis show that transition fatigue mediates the relationship between sunk costs and intermittent discontinuance and the relationship between transition costs and intermittent discontinuance.","As shown in Table 4, discriminant validity was assessed by heterotrait-monotrait criterion (HTMT). The results indicated good discriminant validity as all HTMT values were below the threshold value of 0.90 (Voorhees et al., 2016). A multicollinearity test was employed via the value inflation factor (VIF). VIF values were less than the 5.0 threshold. Hence, multicollinearity was not an issue. The Harman's single-factor test was utilized to control the threat of common method variance. The results of the exploratory factor analysis (unrotated) showed that no single construct explained more than 44.9% of the observed variance.

To assess the structural model, the R? of the endogenous variables was computed for the model?s explanatory power (Hair Jr et al., 2017). As reported in Table 5, consumption achieved R? value of 38.6% (pooled data), 32% (group 1), and 36.2% (group 2); contribution 44.3% (pooled), 38.5% (group 1), and 42.5% (group 2); creation 40.7% (pooled), 29.3% (group 1), and 43.8% (group 2); cold BRQ 27.7% (pooled), 17.9% (group 1), and 49.8% (group 2); hot BRQ 51.1% (pooled), 39.4% (group 1), and 49% (group 2); trip decision-making 23.9% (pooled), 20.2% (group 1), and 13.9% (group 2); and cross-buying 48.9% (pooled), 37.2% (group 1), and 54.9% (group 2). To assess the strength of the hypothesized relations, a bootstrapping test based on 5000 subsamples was performed. As hypothesized, brand involvement had a positive effect on ?consumption,? ?contribution? and ?creation? (H1a, ? = 0.612, p < 0.05; H1b, ? = 0.645, p < 0.05; H1c, ? = 0.603, p < 0.05, respectively). Accordingly, H1a, H1b, and H1c were verified. Additionally, perceived anonymity had a positive effect on ?consumption,? ?contribution? and ?creation?

Differences in the path coefficients between the two data sets are shown in Table 6. In the first step, we tested the measurement invariance of composite models (MICOM) (Henseler et al., 2016). Thus, we followed the three-step process. These steps were computing the ?configural invariance,? ?compositional invariance? and ?the equality of means and variances.? . As displayed in Table 5, the full measurement invariance was partially achieved in the comparison between group 1 and group 2 as step (1) was fully established, and step (2) and step (3) were partially established. The following step was related to the employment of a multigroup analysis to test the path coefficients in both groups. Parametric and nonparametric procedures (PLS-MGA and permutation) were applied to investigate group differences (Hair et al., 2018). As shown in Table 5, the findings indicated that significant differences existed in path coefficients between group 1 and group 2. In the relationship between perceived anonymity and ?consumption,? ?contribution? and ?creation? the effects were stronger for group 1 (|??| = 0.113, p < 0.05, |??| = 0.106, p < 0.05, |??| = 0.088, p < 0.05, respectively).",0.38836531628781457,0.7130154,0.802320659160614,0.26191921120525297,0.8575446517306984

To test these hypotheses, a new variable (Prediction accuracy) was calculated by subtracting Actual effectiveness from Predicted effectiveness. The data was submitted to a univariate ANOVA1 with factors of Media (email vs. FtF ? Between-subjects) and Closeness (Strangers vs. Friends ? Between-subjects), and Prediction accuracy as the DV. We looked at the main effect of Media which was highly significant [F (1, 109) = 22.105, p < 0.001,  = 0.169] showing that the magnitude of inaccuracy was significantly larger in email compared to FtF when Closeness levels are collapsed (H1 supported). However, neither the interaction [F (1, 109) = 0.321, p = 0.572,   = 0.003] nor the main effect of Closeness (F (1, 109) = 0.028, p = 0.867,   <0.001) was significant. Hence, the pattern of overestimation is not different among Friends and Strangers groups, that is the closeness between requesters and targets does not improve the accuracy of predicted effectiveness (H1a is not supported). We also asked participants to report their own feeling about the task (Table 1). We looked at the ANOVAs to see if there are any differences across conditions in terms of participants? feelings about the task. As expected, we found that the Friends group perceive requesting to be easier and feel less awkward approaching a target individual compared to the Strangers group. However, the two groups do not predict any difference in the embarrassment after being rejected. No significant interaction emerged between Media and Closeness nor any main effect for Media was observed (see Table 1).",0.5094782841886498,0.659822,0.7965719699859619,0.08147317971652915,0.8460067710067709

Although no predictor reached the significance level for the Friends group (H3 and H4 not supported for Friends), the biggest coefficient emerged for Effectiveness. On the other hand, email was more attractive for the Strangers group due to less awkwardness, less embarrassment, and the convenience of an email request (H3 and H4 supported for Strangers).

The alpha-Levy range column indicates whether the estimated alpha value falls within the alpha-stable Levy range, which is between 1 and 2.

As we can see from the table, the alpha-stable distribution provides a good fit to the data, as the p-values are all very small.

Two separate factor analyses were conducted on FtF and email perspective-taking measures with similar emerging factors as shown in Table A1. Cronbach?s alphas are reported separately for FtF questions and email questions. Separate repeated measure ANOVAs, Closeness (Cls vs. Str ? between-subject) ? perspective-taking index (FtF vs. eml ? within-subject), were conducted for each of the three emerged indices and none of them resulted in a significant interaction between Closeness and the perspective-taking index. It suggests that Participants in both Closeness conditions predicted the same magnitude of change in targets? perspectives when moving from FtF to email. As shown in the last column of Table H1, participants, regardless of their closeness level to the target (main effect of media), acknowledged differences between FtF and email requests for some of the indices and Single measures. We tested whether requesters consider any of the significant indices/measures when predicting the effectiveness of each medium. Index 3 was positively correlated with requesters? prediction of both FtF effectiveness (r(106)= 0.401, p < .0001) and Email effectiveness (r(107)= 0.398, p < 0.001).

In support of H4, resistance exerted a direct negative effect on usage intentions (B = -0.22, SE =.05) and negatively affected perceived usefulness (H5; B = -0.60, SE =.03) and ease of use (H6; B = -0.20, SE =.03). In line with H7, perceived usefulness exerted a positive effect on usage intention (B = 0.71, SE =.03). However, since ease of use did not significantly affect usage intention (B = -0.03, SE =.03), H8 had to be rejected. Finally, we tested the significance of the indirect effects of transparency and tangibility on usage intention through the proposed mediators ? creepiness, resistance, perceived usefulness, and perceived ease of use.

Specifically, we ranked respondents by the interval between responses to the two rounds of questionnaires, then we compared the demographic information of the early and late 25% of respondents (Armstrong and Overton, 1977, Sivo et al., 2006). The results (Table 2) showed no significant differences in gender, age, education, and usage experience. Therefore, in line with prior literature (Benlian, 2020, Ke et al., 2021, Laumer et al., 2017), we find that, even with a relatively low response rate, the comparative analysis revealed that nonresponse bias was not problematic for the present research.",0.011077246348898026,0.14564805,0.7426888942718506,0.0,0.46527906617192344
46,133.jpg," The table shows the number of transactions (N), mean, median, mean-median, skewness, minimum, maximum, begin date, and end date for each year from 2017 to 2021. The mean-median is a measure of the difference between the mean and the median. The skewness is a measure of the asymmetry of the distribution. The minimum and maximum are the smallest and largest values in the distribution, respectively. The begin date and end date are the dates on which the data was collected.

The number of transactions increased from 2017 to 2021. The mean transaction value also increased from 2017 to 2021. The median transaction value remained relatively stable from 2017 to 2021. The mean-median increased from 2017 to 2021. The skewness of the distribution also increased from 2017 to 2021. The minimum transaction value remained relatively stable from 2017 to 2021. The maximum transaction value increased from 2017 to 2021.","The longitudinal two-wave design with a time lag between the independent and dependent variables ensured that common method bias (CMB) was alleviated (Sykes, 2015). We also applied the Harmon single-factor test (Podsakoff et al., 2003). We found 10 factors with eigenvalues over 1, and the first factor accounted for 26.75%, lower than the threshold of 40%. In addition, we conducted a fit comparison between the one-factor model and the measurement model (Flynn et al., 2010). The one-factor model fit (?2/df=11231.312/560 =20.06, RMSEA=0.226, SRMR=0.332, CFI=0.182, TLI=0.131) indicated a worse result than the fit of our measurement model (?2/df=1849.975/539 =3.43, RMSEA=0.0072, SRMR=0.051, CFI=0.900, TLI=0.918). Finally, we adopted the marker variable technique to further examine CMB (Malhotra et al., 2006). In particular, the selected marker variable should be unrelated to any other variable in the measurement model (Acharya et al., 2022). We chose the vision of continuity as the marker variable. It refers to the organizational vision of maintaining continuity amidst internal and external changes (Venus et al., 2019), which was an irrelevant variable with two items. Table 3 showed that the correlations between the marker variable and other latent variables were irrelevant. Then, we utilized the lowest positive correlation (r = 0.02) to adjust the correlations among constructs. The results indicated that the difference between unadjusted correlations and adjusted correlations was not significant. Hence, CMB might not be a concern.",0.40988162001301937,0.7969715,0.7857572436332703,0.2885930956225289,0.8425592800592799

Due to the constraints imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, we conducted telephone interviews as the most practical and safe means of data collection. Each interview, on average, had a duration of approximately 10 min. Within the timeframe, we allocated around 7 min for specific questions tailored to each participant, while the remaining time was dedicated to providing a comprehensive introduction to the research background.

50,137.jpg," The table shows the results of a study that measured the conformity of different NFT projects to the MAD Conformity Index. The index is a measure of how well an NFT project conforms to the standards of the market. The higher the index, the more conformed the project is.

The study found that the most conformed NFT projects were those that had a high degree of community engagement, a clear and concise roadmap, and a strong team of developers. The least conformed projects were those that had a low degree of community engagement, a vague or nonexistent roadmap, and a weak team of developers.

The study also found that there was a positive correlation between the MAD Conformity Index and the price of an NFT project. This suggests that investors are more likely to invest in NFT projects that are conformed to the standards of the market.","We used generalized linear models such as LR (Son et al., 2020) in the RRA module to test the hypotheses. Based on the chi-squared test, the goodness of fit of the model was revealed to be significant (p < 0.001) with a small deviance of 66.68. Table 8 reports the parameters of the M1 (LR) model that were significant at the 1% level. Substituting the values from Table 8 into Equation (1), Eq. (3) is determined, as follows (3) Table 8 and Eq. (3) indicate that larger organizations are 6.786 times more likely to face R attacks than NR attacks (p = 0.001), thereby supporting hypothesis H1a. Moreover, if organizations belong to a critical industry, their chances of facing ransomware attacks increase by 5.229 times compared to NR attacks (p = 0.001). This finding supports hypothesis H1b. Similarly, for each unit increase in digital intensity, the odds of R attacks are 13.573 times greater than those of NR attacks (p = 0.001). This result aligns with hypothesis H2a. However, if the network is segmented, the probability of occurrence of R attacks decreases to 0.042 times that of NR attacks (p = 0.001), thereby supporting hypotheses H2b. Table 8 also indicates that for each unit increase in vulnerabilities in the organizational environment, the odds of ransomware attacks increase by 2.734 times compared to other cyberattacks (p = 0.098). This finding supports hypothesis H3. In contrast, if information security governance is properly implemented in an organization, for an increase in every cybersecurity role, the probability of ransomware attacks decreases to 0.421 times that of non-ransomware attacks (p = 0.100), thereby supporting hypothesis H4.",0.4475801730262166,0.6730008,0.8013356924057007,0.2370413105135252,0.8548917258100931
51,138.jpg," The table shows the results of the Pearson's Chi-squared test for the years 2017 to 2021. The test is used to determine whether there is a significant difference between the observed and expected frequencies of a categorical variable. In this case, the categorical variable is the conformity of NFT transactions to the power law distribution. The results show that for the years 2017 to 2020, the p-value is 0.00%, which means that there is a significant difference between the observed and expected frequencies of conformity. This suggests that the power law distribution is not a good fit for the data. However, for the year 2021, the p-value is 0.157, which means that there is no significant difference between the observed and expected frequencies of conformity. This suggests that the power law distribution is a good fit for the data.","Next, in the RRA module, we used the M1, M2, and M3 models to classify attacks as R or NR. The performances of the three models were measured and compared on the test dataset using the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, as shown in Table 9. It is evident from Table 9 that M1 was better than M2 and M3 because its accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were better than those of the other two models. Hence, this study further elaborates on the results of M1 (the LR model).

52,139.jpg," The table shows the results of a Pearson's chi-squared test for the years 2017 to 2021. The test was conducted to determine whether there is a relationship between the number of NFT transactions and the US dollar value of those transactions. The results show that there is a significant relationship between the two variables, as the p-value for each year is 0.00. This means that the null hypothesis, which states that there is no relationship between the two variables, can be rejected. The MAD (mean absolute deviation) and MAD conformity values are also shown in the table. The MAD value represents the average difference between the actual value of a transaction and the predicted value of the transaction. The MAD conformity value represents the percentage of transactions that have a MAD value of less than 1%. The results show that the MAD value is close to 0 for each year, which indicates that the model is able to accurately predict the value of NFT transactions. The MAD conformity value is also high for each year, which indicates that the model is able to accurately predict the value of most NFT transactions.","Consistent with the literature (Islam et al., 2022, Sun et al., 2020, Sun et al., 2021), Table 2 lists the loadings and cross-loadings of the measurement items.

The correlation matrix shows that most of the variables are significantly correlated with each other, suggesting that there is a complex relationship between the variables. The descriptive statistics show that the mean values of the variables are all within a reasonable range. The standard deviations of the variables are also relatively small, suggesting that the data is not too noisy.","All the Cronbach?s a values are.76 or larger, indicating sufficient reliability (Nunnally & Bernstein, 1994).

As shown in Appendix A, all the indicator loadings are.65 or higher, suggesting good convergent validity (Hair et al., 1998). As shown in Table 3, all the positive square roots of the AVE values exceed the associated correlations, indicating discriminant validity (Fornell & Larcker, 1981). To offer enhanced evidence of discriminant validity, we tested and found that all the 95% confidence intervals of the correlations are smaller than all the positive square roots of the AVE values. Psychometric properties may include reliability, validity, and model fit performance.

54,140.jpg," The Pearson's Chi-squared test is a statistical test that is used to determine whether the distribution of a set of data fits a particular distribution. In this case, the data is the distribution of the first digits of NFT prices. The null hypothesis is that the distribution of the first digits of NFT prices follows Benford's law. The alternative hypothesis is that the distribution of the first digits of NFT prices does not follow Benford's law.

The results of the Pearson's Chi-squared test show that the p-value for each year is less than 0.05, which means that the null hypothesis is rejected. This means that the distribution of the first digits of NFT prices does not follow Benford's law.

This finding is consistent with the findings of other studies that have found that the distribution of the first digits of prices in financial markets does not follow Benford's law. This suggests that there may be some underlying factors that are causing the distribution of prices in financial markets to deviate from Benford's law.","We obtained 546 complete responses through a two-wave data collection process.

Although not all the path coefficients in our structural model have significant coefficients, the bootstrapping results indicate that all the mediations are significant. This is reasonable, as the bootstrapping method is designed to test the interactions of the path coefficients. Therefore, a single large path coefficient can result in a significant interaction among path coefficients.

The model was significant, F(5, 264) = 3.56, p = .004, and explained 5% of the variance in the dependent variable, project description. In Step 3, the interaction between crowdfunding platform type and prosocial motivation was added to the model. The model was significant, F(6, 263) = 3.67, p = .002, and explained 7% of the variance in the dependent variable, project description. In Step 4, the interaction between project type and prosocial motivation was added to the model. The model was significant, F(7, 262) = 3.89, p = .001, and explained 10% of the variance in the dependent variable, project description.

From the results, we can see that prosocial motivation was a significant predictor of project description, even after controlling for the effects of gender, age, income, and crowdfunding platform type. This suggests that people who are motivated by prosocial concerns are more likely to write project descriptions that are informative and engaging. Additionally, the interaction between crowdfunding platform type and prosocial motivation was significant, suggesting that the effect of prosocial motivation on project description is different for different types of crowdfunding platforms. Finally, the interaction between project type and prosocial motivation was significant, suggesting that the effect of prosocial motivation on project description is different for different types of projects.","In total, we received 213 complete responses, which were screened in multiple steps, resulting in 206 valid responses. We excluded 1 response from South Africa, as it was from outside of Europe, and removed 6 responses for inattentive responding (< 0.5 sd in the responses) or for responding at a speed that would be impossible to do attentively (< 5 min). The sample was then examined for missing data. We found two missing values for USE_3 (see Appendix C, Table C1), which were imputed with the median value of the item. Finally, we screened the remaining responses that failed the attention-trap question. We found sufficient variance in their answers, and the respondents took a sufficiently long enough time (> 10 min) to complete the survey. Demographic information about the respondents (n = 206) can be found in Table 1. As can be seen from the table, the survey responses were collected from top management (61), middle management (65), lower management (51), and experts (29).

As the first step in assessing the indicator and construct validities, we examined the standardized item loadings for the constructs. All loadings were statistically significant (p < 0.001) and above the recommended 0.707 threshold (Fornell & Larcker, 1981), except for one RESI item, which had a loading of 0.689. Thus, this item was dropped from subsequent analyses. The constructs, items, and their means, standard deviations, and standardized factor loadings are presented in Appendix C (Table C1). Next, we used the Master Validity plug-in of Gaskin et al. (2019) to analyze the discriminant validity of our measurement model (Table 3). According to Fornell and Larcker (1981), the composite reliability (CR) value of all constructs should be above 0.7, the average variance extracted (AVE) should be above 0.5 and larger than the maximum shared variance (MSV), and the square root of each AVE should be larger than all other correlations with the other variables. The CR, AVE, MSV, and square root of the AVE (bolded in diagonal) are reported in Table 3. As can be seen, our data fit all the aforementioned criteria, indicating sufficient convergent and discriminant validity for our model.",0.21658978072454105,0.7424872,0.8283252120018005,7.474801712640877e-08,0.7849867724867723
60,146.jpg," The table shows the perkembangan of Airbnb in Romania from 2018 to 2020. The number of active listings decreased from 42,028 in 2018 to 36,012 in 2020. The total revenue decreased from $439,323,137.22 in 2018 to $121,072,214.67 in 2020. The number of nights booked decreased from 3,650,895 in 2018 to 1,162,574 in 2020. The occupancy rate decreased from 41.35% in 2018 to 16.34% in 2020. The revenue per available night decreased from $49.75 in 2018 to $17.02 in 2020.

The decrease in the number of active listings, total revenue, number of nights booked, occupancy rate, and revenue per available night from 2018 to 2020 can be attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic caused a significant decrease in the number of people traveling, which led to a decrease in the demand for Airbnb listings.","We opted to evaluate the model fit for the measurement and path models using the CFI, SRMR, and RMSEA measures. This is in line with the recommendations of Hair et al. (2014), who suggested that model fit should be evaluated with at least one absolute fit measure (e.g., SRMR and RMSEA) and one incremental fit index (e.g., CFI). The suggested cutoffs for these fit measures are = 0.95 for CFI, = 0.08 for SRMR, and = 0.08 for RMSEA, along with > 0.05 for its PClose (Hair et al., 2014). As shown in Table 4, the measurement model?s values were excellent for all of these fit indices. The model?s normed chi-square (?2/df) was 1.515, which falls within the suggested range of 1?3 (Hair et al., 2014). The chi-square test was statistically significant (p < 0.05), indicating poor fit with the data; however, this is common with complex models and larger sample sizes (Schermelleh-Engel et al., 2003). Moreover, Hair et al. (2014) recommend that this measure should not be examined independently but in the context of other model fit measures. As all the other model fit indices were excellent, we can conclude that the measurement model fit the data well. After we moved on to the hypothesis-testing phase, we also evaluated the path model?s fit. Again, the measures were still excellent except for CFI (0.946), which was still close to excellent fit, but within acceptable range (= 0.9) nonetheless.",0.25209315734677257,0.5223066,0.7833763957023621,0.2083439822276784,0.785861547242144
61,147.jpg," The table shows the descriptive statistics of Airbnb listings in the United States from 2018 to 2020. The occupation rate is the percentage of nights that a listing is booked. The revenue per active night is the average amount of money that a listing earns per night that it is booked.

The occupation rate and revenue per active night both decreased from 2018 to 2020. This is likely due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused a sharp decline in travel and tourism. The occupation rate fell from 51.09% in 2018 to 17.77% in 2020. The revenue per active night fell from $61.83 in 2018 to $14.47 in 2020.

The decline in the occupation rate and revenue per active night was likely caused by a number of factors, including:

* A decrease in the number of travelers
* An increase in the supply of Airbnb listings
* A decrease in the average length of stay
* A decrease in the average daily rate

The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the Airbnb industry. The decline in the occupation rate and revenue per active night is likely to continue in the short term, as the pandemic continues to weigh on the travel and tourism industry. However, the long-term impact of the pandemic on the Airbnb industry is uncertain.","Four out of twelve of the paths were significant at the p < 0.001 level, two at the p < 0.01 level, and one at the p < 0.05 level.

62,148.jpg," The table shows the results of the credit portfolio stress test. The stress test was conducted on a portfolio of loans that were originated in 2018 and 2019. The portfolio was divided into three risk categories: flexible, moderate, and strict. The stress test was conducted under two scenarios: a benchmark scenario and a shock scenario.

In the benchmark scenario, the unemployment rate was assumed to increase from 3.9% in 2018 to 10% in 2019. In the shock scenario, the unemployment rate was assumed to increase from 3.9% in 2018 to 15% in 2019.

The results of the stress test showed that the portfolio was most sensitive to the shock scenario. In this scenario, the portfolio's loss rate increased from 0.29% in 2018 to 7.39% in 2020. The portfolio's capital ratio also declined from 10.49% in 2018 to 3.42% in 2020.

The results of the stress test also showed that the portfolio was more sensitive to the flexible risk category. In the shock scenario, the loss rate for the flexible risk category increased from 2.81% in 2019 to 12.50% in 2020. The capital ratio for the flexible risk category also declined from 8.56% in 2019 to 1.56% in 2020.

The results of the stress test suggest that the portfolio is vulnerable to economic downturns. The portfolio is particularly sensitive to the flexible risk category. The results of the stress test also suggest that the portfolio's capital ratio is not sufficient to absorb losses in a severe economic downturn.","Besides testing for the direct effects of each antecedent, we also carried out additional mediation analysis by testing for the indirect effects of the six TOE-based antecedents on organizational XR adoption intention via the perceived organizational value of XR and expected employee resistance to XR constructs. In addition, we tested whether the effect of expected employee resistance to XR on organizational XR adoption intention was mediated via the perceived organizational value of XR. This analysis was carried out using the latent mediation estimand and the Indirect Effects plugin created by Gaskin et al. (2020). The statistically significant paths are presented in Table 6.

About 15% of U.S. citizens contract foodborne illnesses annually, while severe harm is much less common (some 3000 die each year). The U.S. Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) accepts 7.5% of salmonella-positive chicken carcasses and ground beef samples, with harm levels below 0.5% and around 420 U.S. deaths annually. General consumer goods have a different profile. Tracking the number of faulty products sold per year, the U.S. Dept. of Commerce only recalls 0.1%.

Therefore, H2a, H2b, and H2d are supported, but H2c and H2e are not supported.

In Model 3, we examine the moderating effects of industry dynamism. The results show that the positive relationship between AI-enabled marketing analytics and firm performance is stronger in industries with high dynamism (β = 0.334, p < 0.05). The positive relationship between AI-enabled marketing automation and firm performance is also stronger in industries with high dynamism (β = 0.290, p < 0.05).

74,159.jpg," The table shows the results of a study that examined the relationship between consumer state anxiety (CSA) and three types of consumer behavior: hedonic, utilitarian, and social. The results show that CSA is positively related to hedonic and utilitarian consumption, but negatively related to social consumption. This suggests that when consumers are feeling anxious, they are more likely to engage in activities that are focused on their own pleasure or that are practical and useful, but less likely to engage in activities that involve interacting with others.

The study was conducted using a survey of 200 consumers. The survey measured CSA using a 10-item scale. The three types of consumer behavior were measured using 10-item scales for each type of behavior. The results were analyzed using structural equation modeling.

The findings of this study have implications for marketers. Marketers should be aware of the relationship between CSA and consumer behavior. They should also be aware of the different ways that consumers cope with anxiety. This information can be used to develop marketing strategies that are more effective at reaching and engaging consumers who are feeling anxious.","We performed an ANOVA to test the linearity of the relationships between variables [100,82], the results of which are presented in Table 6. The results show that there are linear relationships between the dependent (use intention) and independent variables, since all p-values are below 0.05.

The reliability analysis included three indicators of internal consistency: Cronbach's alpha (CA; [102]), the Rho coefficient and composite reliability (CR; [103]). The values for all three tests were above the recommended minimum value of 0.7. We assessed CR using average variance extracted (AVE). The AVE indicates the amount of variance a variable obtains from its indicators relative to the amount of variance caused by measurement error. All the AVE values were above the recommended minimum value of 0.5 [104].

To address this issue, we conducted a multigroup analysis, following the approach outlined by Hair et al. [105]. We compared the group of respondents who completed the survey promptly (within the first 5 days of issue) with the group of respondents who completed it later. The results indicated that there were no statistically significant differences between these two groups in terms of all variables (p > 0.05). Consequently, it can be concluded that the potential impact of nonresponse bias on the sample data is likely to be minimal or negligible [106]. Next, we assessed discriminant validity by comparing the squared AVE with the intercorrelation scores. Discriminant validity is achieved if the squared AVE of a variable is greater than the intercorrelation with other variables [107]. We further checked discriminant validity by applying the heterotrait-monotrait (HTMT) ratio. Henseler et al. [108] suggest that a HTMT ratio score above 0.90 indicates a discriminant validity issue. The HTMT ratio scores were all below the threshold, indicating that discriminant validity was achieved (see Table 9).",0.3364463679888877,0.7819489,0.815687358379364,0.20148626951993417,0.8260381593714926

Correlation between remote work and COVID-19,"First, we tested the research hypotheses by comparative analysis of the coefficients obtained by OLS, using IBM SPSS v20 as a simulation tool. The results, presented in Table 10, confirm that none of the initial eight hypotheses derived from the extended UTAUT2 model could be rejected?that is, that all eight predictors have a statistically significant influence on the dependent variable (use intention).

*p < .05. **p < .01. ***p < .001.","We also assessed the predictive ability of the model by determining the squared multiple correlation coefficient (R2). The R2 value for use intention was 0.708, meaning that it explains a high proportion of the variance of the model. Furthermore, we examined the standardised root mean square residual (SRMR) value [108] to test the difference between the observed correlation and the predicted correlation as an indicator of model fit. A value of less than 0.08 is considered acceptable. The model proposed in this study yielded a value below this threshold (0.046). We also evaluated effect size (f2) after reviewing research from Chin [109], who indicated that f2 values of 0.02?0.15, 0.15?0.35 and 0.35 or higher suggest that an independent or exogenous latent variable has a small, moderate or large effect, respectively, on a dependent latent variable. The relationship between the variables in the present study was found to exert a significant effect, and the lowest value with regard to f2 pertained to the relationship between perceived value and use intention. Finally, we assessed the predictive relevance of the model using Stone-Geisser's Q2 value. According to Chin [109], a model demonstrates good predictive relevance when its Q2 value is greater than zero. Thus, the present value can be considered adequate. Table 10 summarises all of these results.",0.3321868640888359,0.8484519,0.8130132555961609,0.045971462784504535,0.8292456617456616

8. Industry's average RSE in t1
9. Industry's average RSE in t2
10. Industry's average RSE in t3

The correlation matrix shows that there is a strong positive correlation between the firm's remote work initiatives in t1 and t2 (r = 0.411) and between the firm's remote work initiatives in t2 and t3 (r = 0.506). This suggests that firms that are more proactive in implementing remote work initiatives in one year are more likely to continue to do so in subsequent years.

There is also a strong positive correlation between the firm's RSE in remote work in t1 and t2 (r = 0.705) and between the firm's RSE in remote work in t2 and t3 (r = 0.775). This suggests that firms that have a higher level of RSE in remote work in one year are more likely to have a higher level of RSE in remote work in subsequent years.

There is a negative correlation between the firm's remote work initiatives in t1 and the firm's RSE in remote work in t1 (r = -0.233). This suggests that firms that are more proactive in implementing remote work initiatives are less likely to have a high level of RSE in remote work.

There is also a negative correlation between the firm's remote work initiatives in t2 and the firm's RSE in remote work in t2 (r = -0.164) and between the firm's remote work initiatives in t3 and the firm's RSE in remote work in t3 (r = -0.211). This suggests that firms that are more proactive in implementing remote work initiatives are less likely to have a high level of RSE in remote work in subsequent years.

These findings suggest that firms that are more proactive in implementing remote work initiatives are more likely to have a lower level of RSE in remote work. This is because remote work initiatives can help to reduce the costs associated with RSE, such as the costs of recruiting and training new employees, and the costs of providing employees with the necessary equipment and support to work remotely.","One of the potential problems associated with ANNs is overfitting [86], which occurs when the model ?memorises? data from the training sample and loses the ability to generalise when used with previously unseen data. To avoid this problem, we performed 10-fold cross validation [[95], [115]]. A common measure of the prediction accuracy of ANN models is RMSE [91,99] (Table 11). The low RMSE values presented in Table 11 indicate good reliability and high prediction accuracy for the proposed model [101,50]. Finally, we further evaluated the performance of the ANN model by determining its goodness-of-fit coefficient R2 [116,100], using the following formula: where   is the variance of the desired output. The value R2 = 0.957 indicates that the ANN acceptance model explains 95.7 % of the variance of use intention (model output), which is a significant improvement on the PLS-SEM results.",0.2241387104563217,0.74921453,0.7850008606910706,0.39805825242718446,0.788835177168511

The Cost-Sensitive Classification component predicts the probability that a customer will accept an upgrade offer. This model is trained using a three-layer deep learning model. 

The Revenue Maximizer component then uses the predicted probabilities to assign customers to different upgrade offers. The goal of this component is to maximize the revenue generated from upgrade offers.","Finally, we performed a sensitivity analysis of the ANN model to determine the importance of each predictor. The importance of a predictor measures the significance of the changes in the output caused by changes in different predictors [62]. The normalised importance is calculated by dividing the importance values of each predictor by the largest importance value [91].

Finally, the two least influential predictors were PRISK (0.087) and PRI-VAL (0.057), which was also predicted by SEM-PLS findings. These minor differences between the ANN and SEM-PLS findings can be explained by the higher prediction accuracy of the ANN model and its capacity to consider any nonlinear relationships among the variables [[50], [62]].

The decision specifically focused on choosing between a female candidate and a male candidate. This scenario aimed to simulate the use of algorithms in real-world promotion decisions, which have significant implications for individuals? lives and careers [108]. To ensure that the sample met the requirements of our study, we included a screening question asking participants about their roles in their respective firms.

The average variance extracted (AVE) for all constructs exceeded the suggested 0.50 threshold [28], thereby demonstrating good reliability and internal consistency (Table 4), except for our control variable, social desirability (AVE = 0.475). Because social desirability slightly falls below the 0.50 threshold but has a CR of 0.729, we kept social desirability in our model (cf. [28]). All indicators loaded significantly on their latent constructs, and standardized loadings exceeded the required minimum of 0.700, indicating good convergent validity, except for social desirability (Appendix D).

Regarding the number of key statistics in Table 1, on the average, projects attract about 5 investors and raise nearly ?10,000 daily. While the daily average number of investors in equity crowdfunding is comparable to that in other types of crowdfunding markets, such as reward-based crowdfunding [45] or lending-based crowdfunding [24,49], their daily fundraising volume is much higher.

The results show that there is a significant difference between TAR-PUB and TAR-PRV in terms of MPL (t = 8.5, p < 0.001) and MPR (t = 6.9, p < 0.001). This indicates that TAR-PUB has a higher mean path length and a higher mean path rank than TAR-PRV. This means that TAR-PUB is more efficient in terms of information dissemination.

There is also a significant difference between TAR-PUB and TAR-OL in terms of MPL (t = 7.5, p < 0.001) and MPR (t = 6.5, p < 0.001). This indicates that TAR-PUB has a higher mean path length and a higher mean path rank than TAR-OL. This means that TAR-PUB is more efficient in terms of information dissemination.

However, there is no significant difference between TAR-PRV and TAR-OL in terms of MPL (t = 1.2, p = 0.23) and MPR (t = 1.5, p = 0.14). This indicates that TAR-PRV and TAR-OL are equally efficient in terms of information dissemination.

Results of the hypotheses testing,"Given that the measurement models of our predictors?OAA and SAA?are formative, specific criteria for assessing formative measurement models need to be applied. Some researchers propose that item weights that are significant at the 0.05 level and greater than 0.1 demonstrate high relevance for the formative construct [59]. Not all of our indicators met this criterion (Table 5). However, a simulation study by He [67] shows that it might be misleading and overly simplistic to assess indicator validity based on item weights only. He [67] argues that the contribution of individual items to the formative construct might be obscured by shared variance between indicators. This variance affects neither the predictive power nor the reliability of the construct. Despite the diverging views, there is an agreement not to omit items in formative models purely on statistical grounds. Dropping items alters the meaning of the formative construct and therefore is not recommended [58,59,63,67]. Hence, we kept all items, as each one covered a specific aspect of the constructs that emerged in our qualitative study. Another criterion for indicator validity is variance inflation factors (VIF) below 10 [59,68].

Results from Table 2 show that and scores from Chi-squared and Mantissa Arc tests necessitate rejection of the null hypothesis for all months. As a robustness check, we run a Distortion Factor Model, which is capable of revealing overstatement and understatement in data.

126,206.jpg," Table 4 reports the results of the second-stage regressions. The dependent variable is the cumulative abnormal return over the event window (−15, +15). All models include year and month fixed effects. The results show that the coefficient on the interaction between the implementation dummy and R&D intensity is positive and significant, suggesting that firms with higher R&D intensity benefit more from implementing the consortium. This finding is consistent with the idea that R&D intensity is a measure of a firm's technological sophistication, and that firms with higher technological sophistication are better able to exploit the benefits of collaboration. 
The coefficient on the interaction between the implementation dummy and advertising intensity is also positive and significant, suggesting that firms with higher advertising intensity also benefit more from implementing the consortium. This finding is consistent with the idea that advertising intensity is a measure of a firm's marketing capabilities, and that firms with stronger marketing capabilities are better able to exploit the benefits of collaboration. 
The coefficient on the interaction between the implementation dummy and the number of patents is positive and significant, suggesting that firms with more patents also benefit more from implementing the consortium. This finding is consistent with the idea that the number of patents is a measure of a firm's innovative capabilities, and that firms with stronger innovative capabilities are better able to exploit the benefits of collaboration. 
Overall, the results of the second-stage regressions provide evidence that firms with higher R&D intensity, higher advertising intensity, and more patents benefit more from implementing the consortium. This suggests that firms with stronger technological sophistication, marketing capabilities, and innovative capabilities are better able to exploit the benefits of collaboration.","Next, we investigate whether clustering takes place in NFT sales prices. Since human traders use round numbers as a mental heuristic to save time, such a test is well-suited to identify potential automatic trades, which often manifest in clusters. For each period, we divide the data into two groups: one with prices that are exact multiples of 1000 base units and another with prices within a 500 unit radius from multiples of 1000 base units. The base for the analysis is 4?10 units. The results of the clustering test in Table 3 show that, for 33 out of the 42 time periods analyzed, ~40 % of the trades are clustered around rounded values.

128,208.jpg," The table shows the results of a mediation analysis. The first column shows the model, the second column shows the R^2 value, the third column shows the path 1 robust F value, and the fourth column shows the path 2 robust F value.

The baseline model has an R^2 value of 0.173. Adding only the premises increases the R^2 value to 0.252, and the path 1 robust F value is significant (p < 0.001). Adding only the host increases the R^2 value to 0.190, and the path 2 robust F value is significant (p < 0.001). Adding both the premises and the host increases the R^2 value to 0.255, and both the path 1 and path 2 robust F values are significant (p < 0.001).

This suggests that both the premises and the host are significant mediators of the relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable.","The upshot of the three tests described above is this: the trading patterns suggest high probability of abnormal and computer-generated trading both symptoms of wash trading and price manipulation. However, since we apply multiple tests on the same dataset, concerns over type-1 error and p-hacking may surface. Hence, we perform a multiple hypothesis test using Fischer's method with the null hypothesis that NFT trades are consistent with universal patterns in traditional financial markets. The combined results in Table 5 show a rejection of the null hypothesis for all months alleviating the aforementioned concerns. Our results contradict traditional asset stylized facts. For instance, Corazza et al. [68] show that prices of S&P 500 stocks generally follow Benford's Law but not during extreme events; e.g. the September 11 attack in 2001 or the crash during the Global Financial Crisis.

For contribution customer engagement, the mean difference between the two groups was 0.1907, with a 95% CI of [0.0965, 0.2849]. This means that the marketing campaign led to a statistically significant increase in contribution customer engagement.

For perceived anonymity, the mean difference between the two groups was -0.1299, with a 95% CI of [-0.2236, -0.0362]. This means that the marketing campaign led to a statistically significant decrease in perceived anonymity.

The other four outcomes were consumption customer engagement, creation customer engagement, cross-buying, and trip-planning. The results for these outcomes were not statistically significant.","Table 6 shows the estimates of the econometric model when RevPAN in 2020 was considered as the dependant variable and tested on the sample of strict cancellation policy adopters in 2019.

151,37.jpg," The table shows the results of a study that compared how easy it is for people to seek help from friends versus strangers. The study also compared how awkward and embarrassed people feel when they are rejected by friends versus strangers.

The results show that people find it easier to seek help from friends than from strangers. They also feel less awkward and embarrassed when they are rejected by friends than by strangers.

These findings suggest that friends provide a more supportive environment for people who are seeking help. Friends are more likely to be understanding and helpful, and they are less likely to reject someone who is in need.","Sample companies were purposely selected to obtain information-rich data that were able to contribute to a deeper understanding of the perceptions, concerns, and behavior related to social media use [109]. The interviewees were all key informants at their respective companies, i.e., owner- or business-managers, or executives responsible for their firms? social media management (see Table 1). A snowball sampling procedure [122] was employed, initiated via the first author's acquaintances. The use of natural social ties for accessing the ?elite informants? [119,122] counterbalanced the often prevailing asymmetry in the power relationship between interviewer and interviewee. To represent the heterogeneity of the SME area, the interview participants varied along several dimensions, such as gender, education, social media experience levels, and age. The participants? ages spanned from 23 to 71 years, with a job tenure ranging from 1 year to 30 years and more. This long period of service for a company applied to the owner-managers and founders of a hotel (SME 9), a men's shoe fashion wholesale (SME 15), and a firm consulting entrepreneurial couples (SME 18). Valuable insights into the research topic also resulted from the respondents' various social media worlds and accounts thereof complementing each other. Particularly, young participants aged under 35 years, acting in car and fashion retail or online marketing (SME 7, 8, 14, and 16), seemed to feel superior in knowledge and experience with social media to members of other age groups within and beyond their companies. Apart from the 42-year-old, socially and politically highly engaged owner-manager of a book retail shop (SME 13), all firm leaders were male. Most of the female participants held positions of a business, marketing, or social media manager.",0.23049014677690513,0.6742583,0.8049298524856567,0.10623510625693945,0.8516778423596604

The values for AwkEmbar and Money (Effectiveness in terms of earning money) are above the recommended threshold of 0.7, indicating good internal consistency. The low Cronbach's alpha value for Effectiveness (in terms of success) suggests that the items in this construct are not measuring the same underlying concept and should be revised or removed. The Convenience construct has only one item, so a Cronbach's alpha value cannot be calculated.","Although previous investigations [22] found that regular social media activity remains challenging for firms regardless of their size, this study showed differences in companies? behavioral consistencies. As innovation adoption literature in general, and especially in the SME domain, mainly restricts its focus to mere adoption processes, which fail to account for a comprehensive, sustainable use [152], a better understanding of social media usage in terms of (dis)continuity [45] is needed. Initially, executives are equally exposed to a broad bundle of structural, i.e., material and informational, properties of social media [9]. Nevertheless, these features open up different, context-related journeys on which SME managers may embark in conditions triggering perceptions and behavior in terms of this technology as a whole. From a structuration perspective [40], our findings suggest that these structural properties of social media possibly fail to cause triggers unleashing a sensemaking and engagement process. Here, the encounter with few, negatively connotated features may not produce triggers, such as perceiving obligation or novelty [100] for driving sensemaking and steady use behavior. This tendency effect is reinforced by environmental influences, such as necessary protection against competitors or lacking regulatory and market requirements (for a tendential relation between perception of social media features and steadiness of use behavior derived from interview data, see Table 3).",0.2447106326458341,0.8723278,0.804452657699585,0.10610182564975054,0.8268162225993548

The analysis was conducted to determine the effect of various independent variables on the dependent variable, which is the medium selected. The independent variables are closeness, awkwardness, effectiveness, convenience, money, and the interaction of money and closeness.

The results show that the interaction of money and closeness has a significant effect on the medium selected. This means that the effect of money on the medium selected depends on the level of closeness. Specifically, the results show that as the level of closeness increases, the effect of money on the medium selected decreases. This means that when people are close to each other, they are less likely to be influenced by money when making decisions about which medium to use.

The results also show that the main effects of closeness, awkwardness, effectiveness, and convenience are not significant. This means that these variables do not have a significant effect on the medium selected.","Table 2 reports the key descriptive statistics and correlation matrix for the variables applied in this study, with Bonferroni-adjusted significance levels below 0.01.

The results show that closeness has a significant positive effect on the selection of medium, while gender has no significant effect. The interaction between closeness and gender is also not significant.

The results of the bootstrap analysis are consistent with the results of the ordinary least squares (OLS) regression analysis. The OLS regression analysis showed that closeness has a significant positive effect on the selection of medium, while gender has no significant effect. The interaction between closeness and gender is also not significant.

The bootstrap analysis provides a more robust estimate of the standard errors of the coefficients than the OLS regression analysis. This is because the bootstrap analysis takes into account the sampling error in the data. The OLS regression analysis does not take into account the sampling error, which can lead to biased estimates of the standard errors.

Moreover, to avoid common method bias, we employed Harman's one-factor test [138], which reported about 25.2% of variances explained by extracting only one factor, meeting the thumb value within 50% of the variance among all variables. This implies that there was no bias when applying respondents? answers in the same questionnaire for both independent and dependent variables. A reflective measurement model was inspected by conducting confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) via AMOS 26. Given the adequate sample size of 349 responses, the model fitness indices were as follows: ?2 = 656.355, degree of freedom (df) = 409, CMIN/DF= 1.605 (<3), p < 0.001, GFI= 0.903 (>0.9), TLI= 0.944 (>0.9), CFI= 0.950 (>0.9), RMSEA= 0.042 (<0.07). Hence, all the GOF indices met acceptable requirements, indicating that the measurement model achieved a good fit. As shown in Table 4, each item (Con1, Con2) and the first-order indicators (CON, OSO) significantly relate to the second-order latent constructs, the so-called utilitarian gratifications. Similarly, satisfying results were achieved with respect to hedonic and social gratifications and consumer state anxiety. In addition, the dependent variable (in-store purchase intention) was measured through a single item by probing the extent to which consumers were willing to purchase products after using their smartphones in-store.

According to the output in Table 4, all indicators (CON and OSO) are significantly related to the latent constructs, falling between 0.534 (product information seeking via branded mobile apps) and 0.927 (consumer engagement via online brand communities). Second, the average variance extracted (AVE) is considered as the mean variance extracted for the items loading on a construct and is a conclusive index of convergence [142], with a suggested adequate convergence of over 0.5.

Based on the review of relevant academic literature, managerial reports, and news on IT-enabled remote work, a preliminary list of keywords on remote work firms? initiatives was created. One of the authors discussed this list with three IT executives and four HR (business) executives. According to their recommendations and by carefully using their feedback, 20 keywords were selected and used for the corporate news coding protocol (Table 4). We considered these tools to be crucial to deploy remote work initiatives.4 Two of the authors conducted the news coding protocol.

First, PLS is a full-fledged estimator that enables the empirical test of conceptual models in both confirmatory and explanatory IS research (as in this study) by using an overall evaluation of the fit of the saturated and estimated models [46]. Second, all the constructs of the proposed research model were conceptualized and operationalized as composite constructs, and this estimator is suitable to test composite models [48,51]. Moreover, PLS has been used extensively in the IS research area (e.g., [[52], [53], [54], [55], [56], [57]]). We used the statistical software package Advanced Analysis for Composites (ADANCO) 2.1.

Traditionally, this size is often set as a power of two. Table 3 shows the results of PREM for different embedding sizes. We can see that an embedding size of 256 represents a sweet spot.

Recalling that we use an integer programming approach to select the best customers and the corresponding offers, a natural alternative is to use a greedy baseline that works as follows. First, the greedy algorithm computes each customer's expected revenue for each offer. Then, the Revenue Maximizer picks the best among them. For example, if Customer A accepts an offer of $500 with a 0.5 probability and $1000 with a 0.2 probability, then the expected revenues are $250 and $200, respectively. So, the Revenue Maximizer identifies that the best offer for Customer A is $500, with expected revenue of $250. Suppose there is another customer, Customer B, whose expected revenue is $300, and the model needs to select one customer. Here, the greedy algorithm will pick Customer B. As shown in Table 6, the revenue maximization of PREM (ILP) outperforms the greedy algorithm baseline.",0.19458456738450677,0.4663451,0.8029024004936218,0.3525730753183796,0.8228458049886621
171,57.jpg, Moderator and mediation effects on the relationships between independent variables and continuance intention and usage intention.,"We propose a novel multistage approach based on feature development, the offer acceptance model, a personalized upgrade model, and a revenue maximizer. It is worth investigating if one needs such a multistage model in the first place. Specifically, two questions are of interest: (a) What would have happened if PREM used a single-stage classifier? and (b) What would have happened if PREM skipped the offer cost classification component or the revenue maximizer? The results presented in Table 7 address these questions. As shown in Table 7, the proposed PREM approach containing separate and sequential stages provides the best results. If one squeezes all of these stages into a single stage (i.e., if one trains a single classifier that takes all the bookings of a flight as input and returns the list of users and upgrade offers as output), then that gives the worst result. Splitting tasks into the different stages of an ML system clearly improves the performance in this context. Instead of the classifier trying to handle multiple objectives, each classifier in the PREM approach is targeted and focused on a single task, resulting in superior overall performance. Table 7 also indicates that all three components contribute positively. If one skips the revenue maximizer, then the accuracy drops marginally, but there is a steeper drop in revenue capture. Similarly, if one skips the offer classification and runs the upgrade offer determination for every user on the flight, there is a steep drop in accuracy but a smaller drop in revenue capture.",0.1832304967579292,0.8815603,0.8048293590545654,2.1275927538022295e-07,0.7626678876678876

From Table 6, we observe that our sample firms incur a significant loss in valuation close to the event date.

Therefore, it seems that there is a permanent valuation loss for all SCF firms due to the announcement. This negative impact is not immediate as we do not find a significant drop in the [0, ] event window. However, the loss is quite prominent in the [0, ] window.

Interestingly, there is not a single event window where BlockFims incur a significant loss of valuation. On the contrary, Non-BlockFirms exhibit a significant valuation loss across all event windows.

This suggests that the items are measuring what they are supposed to measure and that there is no significant issue with discriminant validity.","This negative and significant CAAR for Non-BlockFirms can be potentially caused by either the higher magnitude of losses of a few sample firms or a significantly large number of sample firms that move into the loss-making domain due to the announcement. We explore the same using a binomial sign test. This test measures whether the percentage of firms earning negative returns on a particular day in a specific time window is significantly different from 50% or not.

We show the results obtained from the MM and C4F models in Table 8. The columns ?Mean (%)? and ?Negative (%)? represent the AARs and the percentage of loss-earning firms on each day, respectively. It yields two important insights. First, the C4F model shows a lower impact of the announcement than the MM model. The C4F model includes traditional asset pricing factors that play an important role in explaining the AAR. Second, there are few days, i.e., Days 1, 9, and 12, when a higher number of firms among BlockFirms earn negative returns. In contrast, Non-BlockFirms earn losses on 7 out of 15 days in the post-event period.

Table 9 presents the estimated CAAV for all sample SCF firms as well as for the sub-samples BlockFirms and Non-BlockFirms across different event windows. From Table 9, it is evident that all sample SCF firms generate abnormally high trading volume around the event day and in the post-event period. The significant increase in trading volume is evident immediately after the event. In the event window [0, ], sample firms on the whole experience a CAAV of 1.335, and the CAAV increases up to 12.454 surrounding the event window (i.e., [-30, ]). This insight is consistent with the low return and high volume relationship in the bear market reported by Chen [77]. Thus, it statistically supports Hypothesis 4 of this study. However, such a significant increase in abnormal trading volume is guided by Non-BlockFirms. Non-BlockFirms experience a much higher trading volume compared to BlockFirms.

The results for models 1 to 4 (as specified in Section 4.3) are reported in Table 11. In model 1, Block_Dummy is found to be positive and significant. This indicates that Non-BlockFirms earn higher valuation loss compared to BlockFirms.

It is also observed that the interaction of Block_Dummy and Capex has a positive and significant relationship with CAR.

The p-value for H4 is 0.507, which is greater than the significance level of 0.05. This means that there is not enough evidence to support H4.

The other hypotheses are all supported by the data. This means that there is a positive relationship between web seal unreliability and distrust in IS (H1), a positive relationship between web seal unreliability and perceived assurance (H2), a positive relationship between authority and distrust in IS (H3), a positive relationship between authority and perceived assurance (H5), a positive relationship between perceived assurance and manipulative intent (H6), and a positive relationship between distrust in IS and manipulative intent (H7).","So far, we find that the adoption of blockchain enables SCF firms (i.e., BlockFirms) to protect against the erosion of firm value during the pandemic. Moreover, R&D and capital expenditure play an important role in this regard. Next, we aim to identify specific predictive factors that guide BlockFirms to protect the market value. We again run a set of cross-sectional regressions where we use CAR of BlockFirms estimated by the C4F model for the [-15, ] time window as the dependent variable. More specifically, we run models 5 to 10 (as specified in Section 4.3) to explain the impact of consortium and implementation dummies on the CAR of BlockFirms and report the results in Table 12. Results of models 5 and 6 reveal that the interaction terms Consortium*R&D and Implementation*R&D are positive and significant. While interacting capital expenditure (Capex) of BlockFirms with consortium and implementation dummies, we find a similar positive and significant association as depicted in the results of models 7 and 8. However, no significant association is observed in case of the interactions between staff expenditure (Staffex) and consortium and implementation dummies in models 9 and 10.",0.4386091374884581,0.89807916,0.8124054670333862,0.466345359086997,0.7950001034746792

One can only speculate why such good ratings are usually given. AirBnB does not provide monetary incentives for reviews, which have been shown to lead to more positive reviews [114]. Possible explanations could be an ex post rationalization of the decision made by the guest (?I have chosen this accommodation, so it must be good?), or reciprocity between guests and hosts [30], [80]. On AirBnB, guests are also rated by hosts and might hope for a reciprocal favorable evaluation of themselves if they evaluated the host and the accommodation very positively.",0.30268943876388005,0.7531709,0.8154205083847046,0.19421896972682356,0.8473826173826173
207,93.jpg," The table shows the conditions for which firm H and firm L will choose to produce a high-quality product in a mixed duopoly. The conditions are based on the values of the parameters $\beta$, $\beta_1$, and $\beta_3$. The table is divided into three regions, and the conditions for each region are shown in the table. In Region I, both firms will choose to produce a high-quality product if $\beta < \beta_1$ and $\beta < B_3(\beta)$. In Region II, both firms will choose to produce a high-quality product if $\beta > \beta_1$ and $\beta > B_3(\beta)$. In Region III, neither firm will choose to produce a high-quality product.","Table 2 presents the results of this analysis. The F values and their significance refer to the comparison to the previous model. Although adding both types of information to the baseline model leads to a significant improvement of fit, the effect of premises information is much stronger. Adding premises-specific variables to the baseline model increases the by almost 0.08, whereas adding the host information increases it by less than 0.02, and the F-test also clearly indicates a much stronger increase in model fit due to the premises information. Consequently, adding the host information to the model already containing the premises information leads only to a marginal improvement. Thus premises information has a considerably stronger influence on price than host information. This result is in accordance with other results from the literature. Although they did not specifically test for differences between premises-specific and host-specific information,Chen and Xie [24] also used nested regression models in which they first added premises-specific and then host-specific variables. In their model, adding host-specific variables increased the from 0.538 to 0.673. ",0.2699652842226363,0.636214,0.8000925183296204,0.2748131481495103,0.840213508174673
208,94.jpg," The table summarizes the conditions for which firm H and firm L will locate in each of the three regions in Figure D1. The conditions are based on the values of the parameters $\beta$, $\beta_1$, and $\beta_3$. The table also provides the values of the derivatives of the firms' profits with respect to $\beta$ in each region. These derivatives are used to determine the direction of the arrows in Figure D1.

In Region I, both firms H and L locate in the same region. This is because both firms have a higher marginal cost of production than the marginal revenue in this region. As a result, both firms are making losses in this region.

In Region II, firm H locates in a different region than firm L. This is because firm H has a lower marginal cost of production than firm L in this region. As a result, firm H is making a profit while firm L is still making a loss.

In Region III, both firms H and L locate in the same region. This is because both firms have a lower marginal cost of production than the marginal revenue in this region. As a result, both firms are making profits in this region.","Table 3 shows the results of this analysis. The results confirm those of the analysis of all premises types.
