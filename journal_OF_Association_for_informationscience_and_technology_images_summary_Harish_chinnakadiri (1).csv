The field of environmental economics, among other things, involves the study of externalities that generate tangible and intangible costs to the physical environment and its inhabitants (Cropper & Oates, 1992). It is often difficult to quantify these costs given the reach of an incident, and the extent of its irreversible impact. For example, significant oil spills cause major externalities that cannot readily be measured, such as the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, which was estimated to have spilled 4,900,000 barrels of crude oil into the Gulf of Mexico in 2010 (Beyer, Trannum, Bakke, Hodson, & Collier, 2016). There are two main types of negative externalities; the first refers to negative production externalities that can cause, for example, air or water pollution through manufacturing plants powered by technology and other forms of engineering; and the second denotes negative consumption externalities that can cause for instance, traffic congestion and noise pollution that are generated by systems (Biglan, 2009). Externalities caused by technologies and IS may be unanticipated, unintended, and even paradoxical (Pringle, Michael, & Michael, 2016).Unanticipated externalities refer to those incidents and system failures that were not factored into scenario planning and risk management processes during systems design and development, such as the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster whereby a substantial wave surged over defences and flooded reactors causing major radiation leakage (von Hippel, 2011). Unintended consequences of technologies and IS are those that were discounted as potential outcomes of a respective system, but nonetheless transpired (Ash, Berg, & Coiera, 2004). An example is the use of irrigation systems for crops, which subsequently contributes to soil erosion and increased soil salinity (Khan, Tariq, Yuanlai, & Blackwell, 2006). Conversely, paradoxical externalities emerge from attempts to use technologies and IS for advantage and benefit, but where the result is a negative outcome on another aspect of the environment. An example is the introduction of Internet of Things (IoT) devices to monitor energy systems to lower consumption that requires the devices to be powered and over time to be replaced, causing often toxic and non-biodegradable e-waste that is disposed of in landfills (Mukhopadhyay & Suryadevara, 2014).A common element underpinning these types of negative externalities is the impact on public resources that are shared by communities (Pigou, 1920). These include the ocean and its fisheries and clean drinking water, amongst others, leaving individuals and communities vulnerable, potentially compromising their health and wellbeing. Furthermore, these undesirable impacts extend to the natural system and environment. These impacts can be linked to technologies and IS that do not suitably consider socio-ecological and socio-technical considerations, and that fail to recognize the value of design, testing and validation, with sustainability and people in mind (Chen et al., 2008, Trist, 1981).The mitigation of the undesirable consequences of existing and emerging technologies and IS necessitates intervention in the form of sustainability transitions (Loorbach et al., 2017, Smith et al., 2005), moving beyond the existing multi-level perspective (Geels, 2004, Geels, 2011) toward transdisciplinarity. At the heart of these transitions is the establishment and socio-technical (re)design of higher education frameworks resulting in new forms of knowledge production, allowing for the design and redesign of human-centered socio-technical systems for sustainability, and consequently for human benefit (Geels, 2010, Verbong and Geels, 2010). The proposed socio-technical intervention would require commitment to a series of stages or flows, as depicted in Fig. 1, which we define as the Socio-Technical Sustainability Design Cycle. These include: (i) establishing a detailed understanding and conceptualization of the tightly coupled natural and human systems in context and in view of interactions and feedback loops; (ii) implementing the appropriate sustainability transition through a process of socio-technical (re)design; (iii) measuring the effect of the design over time in view of the degree to which negative externalities are reduced or mitigated; (iv) assessing the impact on human health and wellbeing, in addition to environmental sustainability; and (v) iterating to ensure continual evaluation of the tightly coupled system given its evolving nature. It should be noted that despite this proposed cycle, there will be cases in which paradoxical externalities occur, which is an inherent and unavoidable characteristic of tightly coupled systems. This occurs for two reasons: (i) events in nature are not always predictable no matter how “controlled” the socio-technical transitions are through, for example, regulation and policy mandates (Smith et al., 2005), and (ii) interventions themselves are a form of “technology” that are subject to independent and autonomous forces that are “uncontrollable” (Winner, 1978).",6.05%,36.41%,70.69%,0.00%,48.76%

The arrows between the constructs show the direction of the relationships. For example, the arrow from knowledge management systems to competitive culture shows that knowledge management systems can be used to create a competitive culture. The arrow from competitive culture to knowledge sharing behavior shows that a competitive culture can lead to knowledge sharing behavior. The arrow from knowledge sharing behavior to quality of care shows that knowledge sharing behavior can lead to improved quality of care. The arrow from quality of care to knowledge management systems shows that quality of care can be improved by using knowledge management systems.","The leading core technologies in the cutting-edge technology fields of IT, energy, automobiles, electronics, semiconductors, biotechnology, pharmaceuticals and materials science, etc. have become dispersed among individuals, companies and organizations across the globe. The integration of these superior core technologies is a source of innovation of new products and services. (e.g., Kodama, 2007).Across various fields in society, IT innovation is changing working practices, lifestyles, the way products are made and resources are used in production activities. IT technology is being incorporated into a variety of advanced devices and contributing directly and indirectly to the reduction of CO2 emissions. IT innovation is driving energy-efficient manufacturing by promoting energy-saving investments and measures. Such IT innovation will bring about “convergence” - the fusion and integration of different technologies and services and the building of business models across different industries.Meanwhile, with the adoption of the Paris Agreement, a new international framework for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and other measures from 2020, all participating countries, including those that are developed, emerging and developing, are strongly urged to take measures to combat global warming. Specifically, Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and the Internet of Things (IoT) have been trending globally in recent years while collaboration and fusion of the IT industry with various other industrial fields is transforming various businesses, social activities and the lives of people. Backing the evolution of these innovative technologies is the convergence of IT and electronics technologies, including sensing and location information technologies, energy management systems (HEMS, BEMS, FEMS, etc.), energy-saving devices and data utilization.Furthermore, smart communities such as smart towns and smart cities, into which many countries are currently pouring efforts, are attracting attention as next-generation social systems that connect homes, buildings, and transportation systems with IT networks to make effective local use of energy. IT solutions including energy management systems such as HEMS, BEMS and FEMS to optimize operation smart meters, renewable energy and EVs, etc., and CEMS to integrate the management of those as well as transportation systems such as ITS are becoming indispensable in smart communities. The development of these innovative technologies will greatly contribute to the reduction of CO2 emissions and enable a dramatic increase in energy reduction benefits. Furthermore, XR technology, which has a promising future, will contribute directly and indirectly to global environmental issues by minimizing the physical resources generated, utilized, and consumed in various processes in social, economic, and management activities.Therefore, IT industries in every country need to contribute to global society by further strengthening technological and business partnerships with various industries, supply chains and venture businesses to promote new technologies and businesses through convergence strategies that will open up the future while understanding environmental contributions such as global warming countermeasures.To date, the advances of IT have shortened the time and space in business processes and supply chains across a whole range of industries, accelerated decision-making and raised business efficiency, and have given birth to new business models that transcend and converge dissimilar industries (Kodama, 2020, Kodama, 2021). IT innovation promotes industry-wide co-creation & co-evolution to improve the global environment and increases the possibility of forming dynamic “global ecosystems” as new value chains (see Fig. 2).",26.82%,91.04%,79.29%,1.79%,83.13%
2,h11.png," The table shows the results of a study that untersucht the relationship between knowledge management (KMS), competitive culture (CC), and quality of care (QoC). The study was conducted in two hospitals. The first hospital had a high KMS and a low CC, while the second hospital had a low KMS and a high CC. The results showed that the hospital with the high KMS and low CC had a higher QoC than the hospital with the low KMS and high CC. This suggests that KMS is a more important factor in determining QoC than CC.","The climate crisis is the largest threat to civilization we have ever faced. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report in 2018 made the science very clear. There are significant climate impacts all around the world even if we limit warming to the recommended 1.5 C. The report also showed there are significant increases in impacts and damages between 1.5 and 2.0 C. These results were fully supported by the IPCC science report (2021). We are building our living standards upon coal, gas, and oil, and few of us want to change our lives, and new global generations are coming that want our living standards. Every corporation wants to be green and practice sustainability even if the reality of the image is most often an illusion or just a fashion (Jevnaker and Olaisen, 2021aaa, Jevnaker and Olaisen, 2021bbb, Jevnaker and Olaisen, 2021aac, Jevnaker and Olaisen, 2021bbd).What is the research situation within knowledge management (KM), information management (IM), information technology (IT) and information system (IS) research? We investigated all academic papers 2016–2020 (N = 481) delivered at the European Conference for Knowledge Management (ECKM). We found that less than 5% of the papers investigated climate issues and concluded that the KM/IM/IT/IS potentially harms environmental-climate issues owing to neglect (Jevnaker and Olaisen, 2021aaa, Jevnaker and Olaisen, 2021bbb, Jevnaker and Olaisen, 2021aac, Jevnaker and Olaisen, 2021bbd).All research consists of problem, knowledge, and methodology sentences. We get traditional pragmatic business-as-usual research when there is an over-focus upon methodology and knowledge sentences and a low focus upon problems. We must start to ask the research questions about environmental and sustainability issues.Through verification and falsification (Popper, 1974), research is expected to come up with theories, paradigms, perspectives (Kuhn, 1962) that explains and explores practices that we may evaluate, giving us either empirical research or critical research (what is acceptable/not acceptable) or constructed research (what is adequate and what is not adequate). Most research is empirical, and to get more focus upon environmental issues, we must get more constructed and critical research setting up the green and sustainable agenda. We must ask the essential questions about if the academic papers involve acceptable or not acceptable climate solutions or if the papers are adequate or not adequate for relevant climate issues.

The `fskms` setting produced clusters that were more consistent with the true labels, but the `~fskms` setting produced clusters that covered more of the data. The `fscult` setting produced clusters that were both consistent and covered a large portion of the data.","Research deals with four paradigms: the empirical, the materialistic (political), clarified subjectivity, and action papers. Jevnaker and Olaisen, 2021aaa, Jevnaker and Olaisen, 2021bbb found that nearly all papers might be classified as empirical and as a form of clarified subjectivity papers in harmony with accepted problems, methodology, and knowledge. We must invite papers in conflict with accepted problems, methodology, and knowledge. These papers will be representing the materialistic political and action paradigms. We must ask how research papers, often in conflict, contribute to climate issues. To get green and sustainable papers, we must get more problem-focused research on climate issues, more critical and constructed papers, more exploring papers built upon sensitizing concepts and less upon definitive concepts, and more political and action-based papers. Most of all, we need editors and conference chairs dedicated to climate issues asking for adequate and critical papers on this topic that might be political, action-based, and problems often based in conflict with existing issues, knowledge, and methodology. A political economy paradigm for the climate crisis in information research is a complement to presently prevailing concepts. KM/IM/IS/IT research and papers might be utilized to be a knowledge café, outlet, and center for environmental issues and perspectives. We might develop an environmental paradigm for relevant KM/IM/IS/IT research. We might define another future for societies and organizations. We might be giving the picture of a pluralistic sustainable future and even a utopia (More, 1973). We already have the experience through AI and robotics forming the fourth industrial revolution and solving the environmental issues is the fifth industrial revolution based upon the perspectives from KM/IM/IS/IT research.

IT/IS/IM/KM are mentioned as essential for all these areas, and there is a need for developing the areas into issues for journals and conferences. The identified focus for research within information research is in Scandinavia sustainable private and public cases where the green and sustainable practices are documented. These cases should be developed into model cases for KM/IM/IS/IT. The cases should be used as action research cases promoting a sustainable practise (Jevnaker and Olaisen, 2021aaa, Jevnaker and Olaisen, 2021bbb, Jevnaker and Olaisen, 2021aac, Jevnaker and Olaisen, 2021bbd).

5,H14.png," The table summarizes the key findings and research gaps in the three research themes: feature intensity, product update frequency, and expert reviews vs. user reviews.

For feature intensity, the key findings are that more advanced features increase perceived innovativeness but risk subsequent overload, and the presence of legacy models with fewer features moderates adoption. The research gaps are what curvilinear relationship exists between feature expansion and sales over time, and how does legacy model availability shift that inverted U shape.

For product update frequency, the key findings are that faster generational release cycles keep products more updated but heighten consumer learning costs, and accelerated sales of older generations depress residual sales of older generations faster. The research gap is what pace of introducing new generations maximizes short-term sales versus long-term brand equity? How does active legacy model availability interact with ideal cadence?

For expert reviews vs. user reviews, the key findings are that expert reviews influence adoption by assessing technical product performance, and user reviews highlight experiential quality from real-world usage. The research gap is how does the volume and dispersion of expert versus user reviews interact to shape sales? When do the review types complement versus compete in driving adoption?","Despite the contribution of the IS/IT industry toward the economic and social welfare of society, IS/IT has often been criticized for having a negative environmental impact. Concerns surrounding the adverse effects both hardware and software have on the environment date back to the Y2K era which led to the massive adoption of enterprise systems (Miyamoto, Harada, & Fujimoto, 2001). These negative impacts include high levels of energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions and toxic disposal of IS/IT systems (Muregesan, 2008). The disposal of electronic waste (e-waste) while following recycling processes has been widely viewed as not being environmentally friendly, especially the impact of fossil fuels or respiratory inorganics (Barba-Gutiérrez, Adenso-Diaz, & Hopp, 2008). Refurbished ICTs are often used in developing countries where devices tend to have a short life-span and subsequently create environmental damage during disposal (Osibanjo & Nnorom, 2007). Studies have argued that electricity is a major cause of climate change, as many power stations throughout the world still rely on fossil fuels to generate electricity (Asongu et al., 2020, Tamburini et al., 2015). Energy hungry technologies such as applications of blockchain in the form of bitcoin, has been widely criticized for producing over 22–29 million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide emission each year. These figures are comparable to the carbon dioxide production of entire countries such as Jordan and Sri Lanka (Marr, 2018, Stoll et al., 2019). Technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), sensors and actuators have a shorter lifespan which leads to increased waste in the environment (Chakraborty and Gupta, 2016, Chakraborty et al., 2014, Nižetić et al., 2020). Digital transformation initiatives such as smart cities have concerns surrounding ICT waste management, energy management and emission management which needs to be addressed for achieving long term sustainability and viability (Ismagilova, Hughes, Dwivedi, & Raman, 2019).From an IS/IT perspective, IoT and Artificial Intelligence (AI) could potentially offer solutions for reducing the impact of technology projects (Salam, 2020). High ICT-driven initiatives need to plan for sustainability by thinking from the perspective of social welfare and e-waste impact (Kar, Ilavarasan, Gupta, Janssen, & Kothari, 2019). Wireless communication technologies need adaptations so that emissions can be further reduced. AI can operate with such technologies to enhance the usage of bandwidth and energy consumption to significantly reduce the carbon footprint of the telecom sector Ullah et al. (2020). Similarly, AI integrated with blockchain has been found to positively impact water management and climate control (Lin, Petway, Lien, & Settele, 2018). AI can manage and reduce energy consumption within smart cities (Şerban & Lytras, 2020). Studies have identified that blockchain applications can improve sustainable practices in supply chain management and agricultural practices (Kshetri, 2021). Similarly, within nano-technology applications, AI has provided benefits through better precision in agricultural water distribution delivering positive impacts on efficient use of natural resources. The communication of sustainability related messages within social media has greatly increased during the pandemic (Grover et al., 2019, Grover et al., 2021, Yadav et al., 2021). The literature has highlighted that during crisis periods IS research can provide “signposting” for sustainability actions through improved digital monitoring, tackling information flow and paranoia, and orchestrating data ecosystems for improved decision making (Pan & Zhang, 2020).The focus towards renewable energy has increased dramatically. The IRENA (2021) report indicates that jobs in sustainability and cleaner energy are increasing exponentially year on year, especially in solar and wind energy. This shift towards greener energy consumption is common across industries producing and consuming technology products and services. There is evidence that if stakeholders are convinced about energy management, their engagement in Green IS/IT programs will increase (Nyberg, 2018).The literature highlights the use of theories such as: Institutional Theory, Resource Based View, Technology Organization Environment framework, Theory of Planned Behavior and Motivational Theory as the dominant models used in the IS literature (Asadi & Dahlan, 2017). Lesser used theoretical lenses such as: Upper Echelon Theory, Self Determination Theory, Green Theory, Norm Activation Model, Elaboration Likelihood Model, Dynamic Capability Theory, Actor-Network Theory and Expectancy Theory. could be used to explore future research relating to environmental impacts of technology.

6,h15.jpg," This diagram shows the process of collecting and analyzing expert and customer reviews of smartwatches. The data was collected from a variety of sources, including CNET, Wired, PC Mag, Engadget, and Digital Trends. The data was then filtered to remove any reviews that were not related to smartwatches or that did not contain any useful information. The remaining reviews were then analyzed using a sentiment analysis algorithm to determine the overall sentiment of each review. The results of the analysis showed that the majority of expert reviews were positive, while the majority of customer reviews were negative. This suggests that experts are generally more positive about smartwatches than consumers are.","We recognize knowledge as a vital resource within healthcare organizations, given their knowledge-intensive use and nature (Agrifoglio et al., 2021, Hossain et al., 2019). The theoretical underpinning of healthcare organizations as knowledge-dependent or knowledge-focused (Sharma et al., 2021) draws parallels from the resource-based view of the firm (Barney, 1991). According to the theoretical propositions of the resource-based view, internal and external sources of sustained competitive advantage rely on the organizational capability to acquire and control rare, unique and hard-to-imitate resources (Barney, 1991). The discussion of knowledge as a complex resource, compatible with Barney’s principles of sustained competitive advantage, suggests a leverage of knowledge as equally complex – relying on optimization through social (soft) and structural (hard) sources (Ahn et al., 2021; Tether, 2005). According to Tether (2005), knowledge-focused organizations, such as service-providing sectors, require dynamic and fluid combinations focused on the creative combination of equipment, technology, and infrastructure (hard sources) and human skills and practice (soft sources). Furthermore, the discussion of knowledge as a strategical resource relying on social dependency and causal ambiguity (Curado & Bontis, 2006) relies on the need to explore more complex mechanisms to the attaining of knowledge, as corroborated in healthcare management discussion of knowledge as an asset (Agrifoglio et al., 2021, Kosklin et al., 2022). Given such a definition, we argue that KMS lies within the conceptualization of a hard source of knowledge capable of performance and innovation, given its combination potential of individual knowledge with organizational knowledge (Serenko & Bontis, 2016).Evidence suggests that KMS can promote healthcare performance (Du Plessis, 2005), improvement of patient service (Darko et al., 2018), efficient decision-making (Du Plessis, 2005) and cost optimization (Ayatollahi et al., 2019). Based on such evidence, we propose that:H1KMS have a positive influence on the quality of care provided to patients by healthcare professionals.When KS via KMS is trivial, the habit of sharing knowledge probably becomes stronger (Serenko & Bontis, 2016). According to Anser et al. (2021), KMS and structures can influence KS. Similarly, evidence from healthcare also suggests that KMS are related to the optimization of knowledge by permitting an increase in knowledge quality, promoting innovation, and establishing grounds for a culture of learning in healthcare (Karamat et al., 2019, Karamitri et al., 2017). According to Ayatollahi and colleagues (2019), the existence of KMS “plays a supporting role for managing the knowledge (…). It can transform the organization’s attitude to KS and can lead to the organizational success (…)” (p. 12). Therefore, we also propose that:H2KMS have a positive influence on the KS found among healthcare professionals.The service role of healthcare allows for the comparison of characteristics between healthcare and other knowledge-intensive settings. Tether’s (2005) view of sources of knowledge in service organizations further permeates our discussion on the social interplay among internal knowledge stakeholders that is vital to achieving competitive advantage (Ahn et al., 2021). Given the socially-dependent features of a competitive culture and the pervasive competitive-focused nature of healthcare as discussed, not as contrary, but as complementary (Ayatollahi and Zeraatkar, 2019, Karamat et al., 2019, Karamitri et al., 2017), we argue that the shape of human interactions stemming from a competitive culture constitutes an organizational soft source of knowledge by promoting a need of learning and development (Anh et al., 2021, Savic et al., 2020). Therefore, we also propose that:H3A competitive culture in healthcare organizations positively influences the quality of care provided to patients by healthcare professionals.Knowledge management-related practices can further reinforce a sense of challenge and promote a learning culture (Parayitam et al., 2021). Considering both the quasi-accidental nature of KS as a behavior that can be promoted by awareness of KM practices, and the strategical alignment given to KM in the promotion of a competitive environment in healthcare (Chesley et al., 2020; Karamitri et al., 2017; Kosklin et al., 2022), we acknowledge confronting influences that contribute to KS. Evidence suggests that the quasi-accidental nature of knowledge sharing (Ipe, 2003) can permeate if a learning attitude is observed (Sabherwal et al., 2023), even in paradoxical environments (Devi, 2023). Although an argument can be made towards the barriers of knowledge flow in competitive and complex structures find in healthcare (cf. Pandey et al., 2021), the individual predisposition to enact on knowledge as a token of power display and organizational need in healthcare (e.g. Karamitri et al., 2017; Kosklin et al., 2022) can be enticed if cooperative-competitive strategies are promoted by the organization (Kovner & Jonas, 2002). Therefore, we argue that a competitive culture can promote KS in healthcare organizations, leading to the hypothesis:H4A competitive culture in healthcare organizations positively influences KS.The underpinnings of the resource-based view of the firm (Barney, 1991) suggest that knowledge is not only a resource strictly linked to the characteristics of a competitive resource, but it can also represent a resource so complex that it relies on individual managerial needs to be exploited, leading to a succeeding theoretical tailored to the complexities of knowledge (Curado & Bontis, 2006) – that of the knowledge-based view of the firm (Grant, 1996). This proposition reflects the knowledge-based view of the firm and suggests that knowledge is an intangible resource that requires dynamic processes in its management (Curado and Bontis, 2006, Singh et al., 2019). As such, knowledge represents a powerful resource to attain organizational performance (Singh et al., 2019), with the challenges of existing in a non-static form within organizational borders, further requiring the need for different sources of influence to be maximized (Moftian et al., 2022).By extension, evidence suggests that healthcare performance is increased when knowledge is exchanged between healthcare workers (Ayatollahi et al., 2019; Karamat et al., 2019; Karamitri et al., 2017; Kessel et al., 2012; Mura et al., 2016; Radaelli et al., 2014), being also positively related to creativity and innovation in such environments (Radaelli et al., 2014). Based on such evidence and considering the individual-level nature of KS in organizations (Nonaka, 1994), we propose that:H5KS has a positive influence on the quality of care provided to patients by healthcare professionals.Fig. 1 presents the research model in Study 1.",35.81%,75.26%,78.92%,0.02%,85.40%

The variable with the highest mean is Sales, with a mean of 145,000. This means that the average value of Sales is 145,000. The variable with the lowest mean is Update Frequency, with a mean of 2.8. This means that the average value of Update Frequency is 2.8.

The variable with the highest standard deviation is Prior Generation Sales, with a standard deviation of 190,000. This means that the values of Prior Generation Sales vary a lot from the mean. The variable with the lowest standard deviation is Expert Polarity, with a standard deviation of 0.15. This means that the values of Expert Polarity do not vary much from the mean.

The variable with the highest range is Sales, with a range of 500 to 12,000,000. This means that the difference between the maximum and minimum values of Sales is very large. The variable with the lowest range is Update Frequency, with a range of 1 to 8. This means that the difference between the maximum and minimum values of Update Frequency is very small.","After the assessment of the measurement model, we examined the path coefficients and the coefficient of determination (R2) to determine the significance of the relationships proposed in the structural model. Following best practices, we use the SmartPLS® bootstrapping procedure using 5000 subsamples and a parallel process technique (Hair et al., 2017). Results show that both KMS (β = 0.482; t = 10.986) and KS (β = 0.128; t = 2.202) have a positive influence on the quality of care provided to patients (H1, H3). By extension, findings also suggest that the existence of KMS positively influence KS (β = 0.168; t = 2.035) (H2). Similarly, a competitive culture also positively influences the quality of care provided to patients (β = 0.105; t = 2.154) (H5). However, results show no statistically significant relationship between competitive culture and KS (H4). Therefore, H1, H2, H3 and H5 were supported. H4 was not supported.

FsQCA is a diversity-oriented methodology that reveals alternative pathways leading to specific outcomes through the investigation of causal relationships and their dependence on contextual conditions. It is a reliable method to examine complex causality (Fiss, 2011) as previously applied to similar research in the healthcare context (Yáñez-Araque et al., 2021). Contrary to quantitative traditional statistical methods, fsQCA does not estimate the effect between variables, but it identifies combinations of conditions leading to an outcome (Fiss, 2011), which is an improvement compared to only providing a single estimated solution for the dependent variable (Ragin, 2008).Complexity theory acknowledges that quality of care results from a complex interaction of influences (Anufriyeva et al., 2020; Moen et al., 2021) and supports research on real-world phenomena in which researchers collect datasets to analyze (Woodside, 2017). Configurational theory accepts that there are alternative ways to achieve the same outcome. Reality is not perfectly linear; thus, the same conditions may produce different effects under specific circumstances (Cuadrado-Ballesteros et al., 2017). Considering the research hypotheses and the literature suggesting it takes an interplay of several conditions to provide quality of care (Desveaux et al., 2019, Hannawa et al., 2021), an argument on complexity of relationships can be made after the discussion of hard and soft sources shaping organizational knowledge (here translated under higher levels of quality of care), taking shape by technological use (cf. Anh et al., 2021; Tether, 2005). Therefore, we propose that:P1High awareness of knowledge management systems provides a technological source contributing to high levels of quality of care.Adding to such rationale, while the nature of KM systems justifies a technological support driving organizational knowledge outputs (e.g. quality of care) the nature of a a competitive culture and knowledge sharing behavior among peers relies on a non-technological, soft source of support (cf. Chesley et al., 2020; Nonaka, 1994).Considering the knowledge-intensive nature of healthcare (Agrifoglio et al., 2021), the discussed articulation between cooperation-based (Karamat et al., 2019, Karamitri et al., 2017) and competitive-based managerial strategies (Goddard, 2015; Chesley et al., 2020) suggests a level of soft source of support that can facilitate decisions supported by knowledge. As a consequence, there is a need to understand the complex interplay of such sources of support that rely on the optimization of social (soft) and structural (hard) sources (Ahn et al., 2021; Tether, 2005). As discussed, Tether (2005) proposes that knowledge-focused organizations, such as service-providing sectors, require dynamic and fluid combinations focused on the creative combination of equipment, technology, and infrastructure (hard sources) and human skills and practice (soft sources). Therefore, we propose that:P2Combined high levels of competitive culture and knowledge sharing behavior provide non-technological sources contributing for high levels of quality of care.We expand on the initial research model with the inclusion of the new propositions (Fig. 3). The integrated model in Study 2 reflects the research hypotheses with the additive nature of the propositions, accommodating the need to explore individual (e.g., soft sources of support (Ogunrinde, 2020)) and organizational (e.g., dynamic capabilities (de Miguel et al., 2022) levels of influence driving quality of care and the different contributions to quality of care - addressing a gap in recent literature (Ayatollahi & Zeraatkar, 2019; Hannawa et al., 2022).",45.59%,76.30%,79.01%,4.43%,85.94%

Then, data is collected through a pilot study and additional data collection. The data is then analyzed and a model is developed. Finally, the theory is elaborated.","FsQCA requires the calibration of conditions and outcomes. Thus, datasets are transformed into fuzzy-set membership scores based on the theoretical and empirical knowledge of the researchers. All the conditions and the outcomes were measured using a 7-point Likert scale based on the average values of each latent variable (Ragin, 2008). This technique allows us to resize data based on thresholds defined in the literature (Fiss, 2011) into full non-membership, crossover point of maximum ambiguity in membership, and full membership (Ragin, 2008). We transformed variables that were measured on a Likert scale into fuzzy sets (Woodside et al., 2011) by applying the three levels from best practices in fsQCA, establishing the cuts at 0.95, 0.5, and 0.05, considering the range and distribution of each scale (Ragin, 2008, Pappas and Woodside, 2021). FsQCA uncovers how conditions combine into configurations that produce the outcome of interest by exploring how set memberships intersect (Renkema et al., 2016).

Overall, the figure shows how IT is playing a key role in the convergence of technologies and the global knowledge economy. This is leading to new opportunities for businesses, governments, and individuals, and it is helping to improve economic growth and competitiveness.","After the calibration procedure and following best practices (Greckhamer et al., 2018), we examined the conditions for necessity and sufficiency. The analysis of the necessity indicates the degree of the effect of a condition on achieving a specific result. The necessity analysis shows that there are no necessary conditions for quality of care (consistency levels below the recommended threshold of 0.9 (Ragin, 2008)). Such results are aligned with the literature, suggesting that to generate quality of care, an interplay of several conditions is needed (Desveaux et al., 2019, Hannawa et al., 2021). When the distributions for membership of either the conditions, the outcome, or both, have a skew, the presence (or the absence) of necessary conditions might have flaws (Schneider & Wagemann, 2012). To overcome this problem, and since the set of the KS condition in this study has a skew toward high membership, we followed Schneider and Wagemann’s (2012) suggestion of reporting the relevance of necessity (RoN). The analysis shows that there are no necessary conditions for the outcome (Table 9).",32.64%,67.93%,80.44%,37.73%,81.81%
12,h20.jpg," The figure shows the relationships between first-order concepts, second-order themes, and aggregate dimensions in the Interpretive Structural Model (ISM). The first-order concepts are the building blocks of the ISM, and they are related to specific aspects of AI implementation. The second-order themes are broader concepts that group together related first-order concepts. The aggregate dimensions are the highest level of abstraction in the ISM, and they represent the overall themes that emerge from the data.

The relationships between the first-order concepts, second-order themes, and aggregate dimensions are shown by arrows. The arrows indicate the direction of the relationship, and they can be interpreted as follows:

- A first-order concept is related to a second-order theme if the first-order concept is a part of the second-order theme.
- A second-order theme is related to an aggregate dimension if the second-order theme is a part of the aggregate dimension.

The ISM can be used to understand the relationships between different aspects of AI implementation. It can also be used to identify the most important factors that contribute to successful AI implementation.","The sufficiency analysis indicates the degree of relation between the configuration of conditions as an explanation of a specific result or outcome (Fiss, Sharapov, & Conqvist, 2013). We adopted the 0.8 threshold for the sufficiency analysis, which is high enough to conclude the level of care is sufficient for the outcome (in this case, quality of care) (Ragin, 2006). The analysis identified limited diversity (no rows with no cases - truth table in Appendix A displaying symmetric consistency and proportional reduction in inconsistency analysis), resulting from no difference between the number of manifested versus hypothetical configurations (Pappas & Woodside, 2021). Such evidence reflects competitive pressures from the context that are likely to discourage undesirable configurations (Miller, 1986). Considering the setting and the outcome of this study, this result is more than comprehensible, and is desirable. FsQCA delivers three solutions. The core conditions are the ones that are both present in the intermediate and parsimonious solutions. In this study, all conditions are core conditions.

Initial research delved into the cannibalization effect, emphasizing the negative impact of new product introductions on legacy models. Stokey (1979) identified a detrimental influence on the sales of previous versions of physical products, leading to subsequent studies revealing intricate pricing and positioning strategies for managing generational transitions. However, the realm of digital goods, marked by unique facets, has received limited scholarly attention. Feature intensity, characterized by the breadth and complexity of product features (Rathore and Ilavarasan, 2020, Sheng and Teo, 2012), has witnessed exponential growth with each new generation of digital devices. For instance, contemporary smartwatches now incorporate thousands of apps, biometric tracking capabilities, and a myriad of productivity features that were unimaginable even five years ago (Joung & Kim, 2023). Despite this surge in information intensity, research has yet to directly examine the impacts on consumer decisions and sales.The accelerated cadence at which new product generations are introduced, especially in categories like smartphones and laptops, poses challenges that warrant deeper investigation. This is particularly relevant for information-laden digital devices where capability layers expand exponentially each year (X. Fu et al., 2020, Fu et al., 2020). Leading brands adopt agile development approaches, rapidly acquiring user input to fulfill feature requests (Santos et al., 2022). However, variations across brands and products in terms of agility and responsiveness introduce uncertainty (Hollebeek et al., 2021). Unpacking these variations represents a gap needing empirical examination. Hence, key digital product attributes like exponentially growing features and accelerated release cycles require greater scholarly attention (Rauschnabel, 2021). As each new generation introduction intensifies complexity and change, it remains unclear how these facets affect navigation and purchase choices. For instance, despite exponential growth in capability layers, no study has directly investigated how information overload shapes consumer decisions when facing feature-rich updates. This constitutes a notable gap in understanding modern decision journeys.As consumers face perpetual updates and expanding feature sets, the conceptualization of expertise plays a key role in navigating choices. Expertise has evolved conceptually from formal-legal views grounded in competencies towards more relational perspectives focused on perceived credibility and legitimacy (H. Hu & Krishen, 2019). Expert reviews provide more credible information than seller-generated content given independence from profit motivations, focusing primarily on tangible product attributes and metrics (Keh and Sun, 2018, Li et al., 2019). However, usage contexts and experiential factors may be excluded, creating potential gaps between technical assessments and latent consumer criteria. This highlights the need to examine purchase criteria beyond performance metrics. In contrast, peer reviews represent first-hand consumer perspectives rooted in real-world product experience rather than formal qualifications (Ansari & Gupta, 2021). While most contributors are everyday users, some highly engaged reviewers may develop authoritative expertise (Wu, 2017). The unique value of peer reviews emerges from emphasis on subjective evaluations of fit with personal needs and usage contexts versus technical specifications. Hence, while existing literature establishes foundational knowledge on generational transitions and management strategies, critical gaps persist regarding digital goods. Specifically, the impacts of exponentially expanding features and accelerated release cycles on consumer processing and behaviors remain underexplored terrains warranting dedicated empirical focus. It remains unclear how information overload shapes consumer choices when facing feature-rich generational updates released at continuously faster rates. Similarly, despite hints of excessive change cycles adversely impacting consumers (Bernstein & Martínez-de-Albéniz, 2017), no study has directly investigated effects on navigation and purchase decisions.This research aims to address these gaps (refer Table 1) by examining variations in information intensity and product update cadence to understand impacts on processing and choice. Outcomes will provide clarification on how consumers navigate perpetual updates amidst intensifying complexity. Additionally, variations in development agility have introduced uncertainty about impacts on purchase decisions; this study will delineate effects. Finally, the divergence between technical expert assessments and experiential peer perspectives represents an understudied phenomenon in digital product contexts. By encompassing both lenses, this research will enrich understanding of modern decision journeys shaped by exponential information growth and accelerating release cycles.",6.29%,78.78%,76.16%,0.33%,80.80%

Focusing on 147 unique brands, multiple forums and reviews sites were scraped over a 10-year period (2012–2022) to compile a robust dataset of nearly 2.5 million reviews, capturing evolving user perspectives. As new products were released over this 10-year period, their associated search terms were added to continuously update the list. This was done through systematically tracking press releases, news articles, and database listings announcing the launch of new wearable models across the 147 brands in our analysis. We manually compiled model numbers, marketing names, and keyword variations for each newly released fitness band. To compile the expert review dataset, the data collection centered wholly on prominent technology publications with global readership including Wired, CNET, PCMag, TechRadar and several similar digital consumer tech journals. These sources meet standard criteria as reputable, independent evaluators of new product performance spanning technical benchmarks and real-world testing. Only expert analyses appearing in leading publications already recognized for their rigorous, impartial assessments were included. The analysis encompassed 147 consumer electronics brands offering 1521 different fitness band and smartwatch models available during this 10-year data collection timeframe. In order to source applicable reviews tied specifically to each product, a predefined list of keywords was compiled separately for each of the 1521 models. These granular keywords consisted of the brand name, product line name, and the specific model number for each variant. As new products were released over this 10-year period, their associated search terms were added to continuously update the list. Multi-word keyword variations were also programmatically created to capture commonly used concatenated forms. On a monthly basis throughout this decade-long window, an automated script submitted API search queries to each publication leveraging these comprehensive sets of ever-evolving, product-level keywords. Retrieved articles were programmatically filtered based on length, publication date compared to launch timing, and on-topic relevance checks. Across this expansive, meticulously sourced set spanning 10 years, 74,512 expert reviews met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed. This comprised an average of ∼49 reviews per model, with 3104 new relevant reviews published monthly - enabling robust expert sentiment scoring tied directly to new product launches throughout the 10-year period. The cumulative search and filtering protocols allowed expert opinions to keep pace with and evaluate new fitness band model releases month-to-month over this extensive timeframe.Similarly for consumer opinions, public forums were identified based both on total membership above 500,000 to ensure adequate diversity of perspectives represented in discussions, as well as requiring an explicit focus on consumer electronics discourse based on a computational topical analysis. Additionally, the Reddit platform itself employs computational content checks to screen discriminatory or unsafe speech, providing a degree of inherent governance. Across the forums, posts were further filtered through automated text analysis removing comments not product-relevant to isolate pertinent opinions. Hence, multiple criteria regarding membership breadth, topical concentration, underlying content governance, and computational relevance checks were applied to ensure consumer data validity. This resulted in 980,000 user reviews and discussion threads being compiled over the 10-year window. To ensure relevance, posts were filtered by a computational topic model, excluding off-topic discussions unrelated to fitness band features and performance. After filtering, 651,000 on-topic consumer reviews and discussions remained, covering the full product set. On a weekly basis, new relevant posts were continually captured, with approximately 9300 new product-related reviews and threads each week across new and existing models from launch onwards. Only reviews emerging in the post-launch window were gathered to represent reactions based on real-world exposure rather than speculation for both experts and consumers. As for geography, a global perspective was adopted given the worldwide distribution and discussion of consumer technology goods. Reviews and sales from North America, Europe and Asia were encompassed without geographic filtering. Polarity scores were finally calculated to represent the prevailing expert and consumer opinions toward each product upon release.To generate these polarity scores, we employed an opinion mining algorithm called VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) developed specifically for analyzing social media language (Hutto & Gilbert, 2014). VADER uses a combination of rule-based syntactic analysis and empirically derived word ratings to classify sentiment on a scale from − 1 (extremely negative) to + 1 (extremely positive). It is well-suited for assessing the nuanced language in product reviews. The VADER algorithm generated polarity scores at the sentence and paragraph level within each article. These granular scores were then aggregated into an overall rating representing the prevailing sentiment of the expert review toward that product upon its release. The final expert polarity scores for each product were incorporated into the dataset for analysis (refer Fig. 2).",33.21%,87.78%,78.40%,6.73%,85.52%

The revised definition is ""The degree to which an organisation follows formal processes for formulating and reviewing strategies, displays executive decisiveness in choosing initiatives, and deploys sound analytic capabilities to support those choices.""","While there are various motivations and triggers to business model innovation, firms often use technologies as key means of achieving business model innovation (Muhic and Bengtsson, 2019). AI can be one of the technologies that underpins business model innovation. A rich stream of research has underpinned existing knowledge of how computing (including machine learning and expert systems) can support human decisions in organizational contexts (see for example Bonczek et al., 1979). There is an equally rich stream of research associated with successful implementation of AI – at least at a technical level (Maragno et al., 2023, Merhi, 2023, Uren and Edwards, 2023).While AI technologies are generally globally available, uptake is non-uniform and the touted exemplars of business model transformation using AI seem to be concentrated in the same few companies, being large multinational companies such as Amazon and IKEA. Furthermore, the current wave of adoption has seen organizations focused primarily on utilizing AI for improving existing business models rather than creating new ones (Deloitte, 2020).The Deloitte (2020) survey identified a set of IS and non-IS capabilities associated with success in AI. Three IS capabilities were identified, the first of these is data. Success at AI is not just about volumes of data, it is about having the right types of data and adequately supported digital processes (Reim et al., 2020). The second IS capability is digital agility, as rapid changes in business models require the ability to scale up and down as well as quickly modify application landscapes, with that adaptability supported and not inhibited by information systems (Grover, 2022). The third IS capability is that of the skills of the technology team themselves (Wamba-Taguimdje et al., 2020). Multiple elements must be in place for successful implementation of AI in an organization including data management as well as having the right domain knowledge and relevant technologies. The Deloitte survey also suggested a critical capability in the non-IS parts of the organization, namely a “digital culture” that enhances organizational ability to pursue change initiatives in parallel with delivering the existing business model.There is limited literature directly considering dynamic capabilities and AI. While Matilda Bez and Chesbrough (2020) explore the usefulness of the top-level dynamic capability framing to the “Partnership on AI” consortium, they do not discuss specific capabilities that organizations might need to successfully deploy AI, let alone the broader capabilities required by an organization to transform its business model through the judicious use of AI technology enablers. Lee et al.’s (2023) recent systemic literature review on the implementation of AI in organizations identified eight organizational ‘themes’. Of these themes, three are particularly relevant to the research question: management leadership & support, market research & competitors, and risk-benefit assessment. Data and technology are two other relevant themes across the other dimensions of Lee et al.’s synthesis, aligning with the survey results analyzed by Deloitte (2020).",43.29%,88.10%,80.08%,3.87%,82.37%

The change relative to literature-based shows how the factors in the model have changed compared to previous research. This can be used to identify areas where more research is needed.","In order to address these research gaps, a research model has been developed. This research model has three broad dimensions, each of which are mentioned in the literature: enablers for capabilities, the capabilities themselves, and the environmental context for the capabilities. Each dimension has two or more ‘sensitizing concepts’ drawn from the literature. A ‘sensitizing concept’ is like a factor (which have tight definitions and measurements) but is less tightly defined and therefore more open to interpretation and refinement after engagement with participants (Bowen, 2006).In the dimension of enablers, three sensitizing concepts are noted: risk appetite (Lee et al., 2023; Wilson et al., 2023), slack (Wilson et al., 2023), and top management support (Kump et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2023). Three sensitizing concepts are also included in the capabilities dimension: ability to run and change (Deloitte, 2020, Kump et al., 2018), AI oriented data / IS readiness (Deloitte, 2020; Lee et al., 2023) and market / customer awareness (Kump et al., 2018). In the third dimension of environmental context, two sensitizing concepts are proposed: industry dynamism (Kump et al., 2018) and opportunity / threat framing (Saebi et al., 2017).To provide a baseline by which the novelty of the findings of this paper can be assessed, these sensitizing concepts have been organized into a literature-based model of factors and presented in Fig. 1. This model of factors has been developed through the logical application of dimensions and sensitizing concepts described above that can lead to a form of performance described as business model innovation (be it either significant or incremental in scale).

18,h26.jpg," The figure shows the relationships between perceived value, trust, and willingness to pay a premium. Perceived value is a multidimensional construct that includes functional value, hedonic value, social value, and price value. Trust is a belief that the other party will fulfill their obligations. Willingness to pay a premium is the amount of money that a customer is willing to pay for a product or service that is perceived to be of higher quality or value.

The study found that perceived value and trust have a positive impact on willingness to pay a premium. This means that customers who perceive a product or service to be of high value and trust the company that is selling it are more likely to be willing to pay a higher price for it. The study also found that the relationship between perceived value and willingness to pay a premium is mediated by trust. This means that the positive impact of perceived value on willingness to pay a premium is at least partially due to the fact that customers who perceive a product or service to be of high value are more likely to trust the company that is selling it.

The findings of this study have implications for managers who are responsible for setting prices for their products or services. The study suggests that managers should focus on creating products and services that are perceived to be of high value and building trust with their customers. By doing so, managers can increase their customers' willingness to pay a premium for their products or services.","The unit of analysis of this study is that of the organization, and multiple organizations (hereafter referred to as ‘cases’) were engaged through their leaders and supplemental data to obtain rich insights from exploration of this phenomenon.A purposeful sampling approach was used. Each case needed to meet four criteria before it was considered for inclusion. First, the case had to be an Australian case, as this restriction to a single legal and regulatory jurisdiction reduces cross-jurisdiction considerations as well as improves access to participants. Second, the case had to be an established organization, one in which existing processes and organizational cultures had to be overcome. Third, the case had to include adoption of AI as a technology enabler. Fourth, the case had to demonstrate at least some threshold level of business model transformation, involving material change beyond incremental innovation. This was due to the authors’ perspective (based on many preliminary interviews with executives) that while many organizations had undertaken AI experiments and proof-points, few had used AI to fundamentally revitalize and refresh their business model. The authors’ view from experience is that there is a significant commitment difference between conducting a pilot or implementing a ‘tweak’ versus committing to a significant business model change.In addition to the four requirements for inclusion noted above, three additional criteria were set for case selection. First, engagement of these cases needed to be at a sufficiently senior level within the organization in order to understand the executive management perspectives on the issues, opportunities and risks associated with business model transformation in established organizations. This level of informant seniority required the adoption of a ‘knowledgeable interviewer’ approach, both to gain access to the informant as well as to elicit depth of insight. Second, cases were sought where those senior executives were willing to talk ‘on record’ about their experiences – while this poses a risk of social desirability bias (Fadnes et al., 2009), this risk was outweighed by the increased engagement of readers through known organizations rather than de-identified cases. Finally, organizations across the spectrum (of industry type, of scale) were sought so that readers could gain a sense of confidence that the findings of this study were relevant across a spectrum of organizations.A summary of the study 1 research process is shown in Fig. 2, framed in the language of the Gioia method (Gioia et al., 2013). The research design phase commenced with using the research model described in Section 2 to develop the initial draft of the semi-structured interview protocol. The data collection phase started with a pilot of the interview protocol. In line with common practice when using the Gioia approach, the semi-structured interview protocol continued to be refined through the duration of the data collection phase. Data collection and preliminary data analysis continued in parallel until the research team felt saturation had been achieved (noting aspecific question in the quality check section of the protocol). Once this was achieved, the data analysis phase concluded, resulting in the development of the data structure.

In the Gioia method, the data structure is the point at which data and theory mesh (Gioia et al., 2013). Not only does the data structure provide an easily understood graphical representation of the participants’ perspective, but it also provides a means to “capture the participants experiences in theoretical terms” (Gioia et al., 2013). The data structure was developed through a deliberate process of reflecting between the raw data (the participants’ comments), theory, and the predictive power of the emerging themes. The data structure is provided in Fig. 3.Twenty-seven distinct 1st order concepts (see Fig. 3) were identified, examples of which are building trust in AI and leader support for experimentation. Appendix 1 provides a list of each 1st order concept and the supporting evidence for those concepts.The 1st order concepts presented here were selected to represent the set of significant concepts discussed by the participants. Using leader support for experimentation as an example, two participants noted the concept. The first comment was made by a Moula participant: “It’s important to have the expertise and leaders working with you, and have the trust and empowerment to just try and experiment and not feel that you have to have everything perfect on day 1.” The second comment was made by a participant from the Urban Arts Project Group: “We have staff who are natural explorers, and we encourage those staff to investigate problem solving, using technology. If they’ve got a good idea, we will fund that. Sometimes it’s a dud and sometimes it’s a great success. I think it’s a culture of trust – a different way of thinking about problem solving.”In the Gioia approach (2013), the 2nd order themes are the point at which data meshes with theory, as 2nd order themes are higher-order theoretical concepts that help explain the phenomena under observation. As an example, the 2nd order theme market / customer awareness is linked to two 1st order concepts: market engagement (reflecting the participants’ active engagement with existing and potential business partners) and understanding of value potential (which reflects the participants’ understanding of potential customer value). In total, nine 2nd order themes were identified (see Fig. 3), each of which were supported by two to five 1st order concepts.The data structure has three aggregate dimensions, each of which are supported by two or more 2nd order themes. The first aggregated dimension is internal behaviors, which reflects the behaviors of the leadership and staff of organizations undergoing business model transformation enabled by AI. This aggregated dimension includes three 2nd order themes: AI-sensitive risk tolerance, proactive leadership, and tech-sensitive innovation culture. The second aggregated dimension is internal capabilities, which refers to the capabilities associated with an organization’s ability to adapt the firm’s resource base (Teece, 2007). This aggregated dimension includes four 2nd order themes: ability to run & change, AI oriented data / IS readiness, market / customer awareness and strategic process strength. The final aggregated dimension is that of external conditions and reflects the fact that organizations do not operate in isolation from competitors and the broader business environment (including regulation and changing social norms). Two 2nd order themes are tied to this aggregated dimension: industry dynamism and opportunity / threat drivers.",32.29%,74.70%,79.77%,0.04%,78.16%
20,h28.png," The table shows the results of a study that examined the effects of trust, functional value, hedonic value, social value, and price value on willingness to pay (WTP). The study used two different models: a limited features model and a virtual items model. The limited features model included only the direct effects of the independent variables on WTP. The virtual items model included the direct effects of the independent variables on WTP, as well as the indirect effects of the independent variables on WTP through trust.

The results show that, in the limited features model, trust, functional value, hedonic value, social value, and price value all had significant direct effects on WTP. In the virtual items model, trust, functional value, hedonic value, social value, and price value all had significant direct effects on WTP, and trust also had a significant indirect effect on WTP through functional value.

The model difference column shows the difference in the R-squared values between the limited features model and the virtual items model. The R-squared value is a measure of how well the model fits the data. The larger the R-squared value, the better the model fits the data. The model difference column shows that the virtual items model fits the data significantly better than the limited features model. This suggests that the indirect effects of the independent variables on WTP through trust are significant.

The p-value column shows the significance of the difference in the R-squared values between the limited features model and the virtual items model. The p-value is less than 0.05, which means that the difference in the R-squared values is statistically significant. This suggests that the indirect effects of the independent variables on WTP through trust are significant.","The data structure has three aggregate dimensions, each of which are supported by two or more 2nd order themes.

This empirically supported model was developed through a three step process. The first step was a case-by-case consideration of how the factors described in Table 4 were discussed by the informants, with a particular focus on the interactions and sequencing of these factors in their cases. The second step was the synthesis of a single perspective from the set of individual cases. The third step was the abstraction of this single perspective into a format similar to that of Fig. 1 to support the subsequent horizontal contrasting analysis.The empirically supported model is shown in Fig. 4 and comprises four main blocks.",0.00%,-5.94%,77.47%,0.00%,68.11%
22,h3.jpg," The diagram shows the relationships between data, practices, theory, values, and attitudes. Data and practices are related to empiricism, which is the belief that knowledge is derived from experience. Theory and values are related to criticism, which is the process of evaluating and judging the validity of knowledge. Data, practices, theory, values, and attitudes are all related to constructivism, which is the belief that knowledge is constructed by individuals through their interactions with the world.

The diagram also shows how these different elements can be in consonance or dissonance with each other. Consonance occurs when two or more elements are in agreement with each other. Dissonance occurs when two or more elements are in conflict with each other.

For example, if a person's data and practices are in consonance with their theory, then they are likely to have a high level of confidence in their knowledge. However, if their data and practices are in dissonance with their theory, then they are likely to have a lower level of confidence in their knowledge.

The diagram can be used to help people understand the different elements that contribute to knowledge and how these elements can be in consonance or dissonance with each other. This understanding can help people to make more informed decisions about how to acquire and use knowledge.","The applicability check was structured around obtaining feedback from three specific cohorts: executives (senior practitioners – typically C-suite or a direct report thereof - that are involved in business model transformation initiatives), advisors (senior management consultant professionals - typically at the partner level - that support executives in their business model transformation initiatives) and practice-oriented researchers (many of which have 10 + years industry experience). Some of the participants of study 1 also participated in study 2 in the “executive cohort”. These three cohorts were selected as each cohort would bring a different and complimentary perspective to the question of applicability of the findings in study 1. In total, 14 participants were engaged in the applicability check process, as outlined in Table 5.Each focus group was conducted by one or more members of the author group. Each member of the author group participated in at least two sessions, and the lead author participated in all sessions, including the initial pilot session.

23,h30.jpg," The figure shows the relationship between perceived value, trust, and willingness to pay a premium. Perceived value is a customer's overall assessment of the value of a product or service. It is based on a comparison of the perceived benefits and costs of the product or service. Trust is a customer's belief that a company will act in their best interests. It is based on the company's reputation, past performance, and the customer's personal experience with the company. Willingness to pay a premium is a customer's willingness to pay more for a product or service that they perceive to be of higher value. It is based on the customer's perceived value of the product or service and their trust in the company.

The figure shows that perceived value has a positive effect on trust and that trust has a positive effect on willingness to pay a premium. This means that customers who perceive a product or service to be of high value are more likely to trust the company that offers it and are more likely to be willing to pay a premium for it.

The figure also shows that the type of service moderates the relationship between perceived value and trust. For hedonic services, the relationship between perceived value and trust is stronger than for utilitarian services. This means that customers who perceive a hedonic service to be of high value are more likely to trust the company that offers it than customers who perceive a utilitarian service to be of high value.","There are four specific results of the applicability check. First, the participants were strongly supportive of the research need. The words of participant P4.1, an advisor, are illustrative of this support: “I think someone needs to tackle this, first of all, and I think you're starting to do that.” Participant P5.2, a practice-oriented researcher, also commented positively about the appropriateness of the selected theoretical lens of dynamic capabilities: “I feel like [the model] is aligned well to the dynamic capabilities theory.”Second, there was a strong sense of resonance with the empirically derived model of factors outlined in Fig. 4. Participant 2.2, an executive, confirmed that, “This model reflects the way I think about the problem as I've gone through various roles.” Advisors similarly thought that the model resonated with their lived experience across multiple situations: participant P3.1 noted: “this model actually does resonate very well with me.” Furthermore, there was a strong sense of support for the six factors introduced/refined/deleted between the literature-based model of factors and the empirically derived model of factors. Nearly all participants commented on the need for proactive leadership rather than the more passive concept of top management support. Participant P2.2's comment was representative of the collective perspective of the executive and other cohorts: “Certainly the proactive leadership part. I think if it wasn't in [the literature based model], and it is there now [in the empirically supported model], I mean, I think that's a very vital part.” The participants spoke about the criticality of the environmental context, often clumping together the concepts of industry dynamism and opportunity/threat drivers. Participant P4.1’s view was illustrative when talking about the lack of change in one industry sector: “I think there's a couple of things. One is the environmental context… the industry dynamism, and the threats - they haven't been there, or they haven't been perceived as being real. There's no real burning platform, no one's hair is on fire to say, ‘Look, I need to do something about this’. And that permeates through to the organizational precursor, and we talk about proactive leadership.” Within the core capabilities, participant P1.1, an executive, liked the sense of discipline implied by the factor of strategic process strength, “I like the strategic process strength [capability], I think that's good. I see an injection of discipline there.” Turning to the enablers, participant P3.1, an advisor, remarked on AI-sensitive risk tolerance: “When I look at the enablers that you've identified: having the risk tolerance, from an AI point of view, this makes a whole lot of sense.” Furthermore, participant P3.1 (an advisor) emphasized the importance of Tech-sensitive innovation culture: “I think [tech-sensitive innovation culture] is probably one of the most important components for me.” Finally, the removal of slack as a specific factor was strongly supported by participant P5.1, a practice-based academic: “I'm thinking about the relationship between strategic process strength and slack, you actually make a great argument by linking that with proactive leadership.”The third major finding is a set of suggestions regarding refinement of two factors, which in turn lead to the refinement of factor definitions shown in Table 7.",45.35%,83.45%,79.54%,19.96%,89.17%

WTP represents its focal construct and its relationships with the perceived value of the free version and trust in the service provider serve as the objects of interest. The four dimensions of perceived value (functional value, hedonic value, social value, and price value) are based on the framework of Sweeney and Soutar (2001). In line with previous studies, we address the direct impact of perceived value on WTP (Hamari et al., 2020, Vock et al., 2013). In addition, we address the mediating effects of trust on this relationship according to trust theory based on self-perception (Kim, 2008).

27,h34.jpg," The diagram shows the four key areas of AI capabilities that organizations need to develop in order to successfully implement AI. These are:
1. **Acquiring AI Resources:** This includes investing in computing power, smart equipment, and cloud infrastructure, as well as building standardized systems and partnering with specialized digital consulting providers.
2. **Accumulating AI Resources:** This includes recruiting and培养人才, increasing the quality of data sources, and educating employees on AI integration.
3. **Coordinating Processes:** This includes enhancing efficiency processes for continuous value creation and optimizing resource utilization.
4. **Mobilizing Technologies:** This includes adopting sustainable solutions, building upon multiple data sources, and developing autonomous solutions.

The diagram also shows the three key areas of AI governance capabilities that organizations need to develop in order to effectively govern AI. These are:
1. **Empowering People:** This includes developing an understanding of AI among people in the organization, and aligning roles toward data visualization and decision-making.
2. **Leveraging AI Resources and Capabilities:** This includes scaling capabilities for organizational learning, establishing a manufacturing 4.0 company, and ensuring responsible AI implementation.
3. **AI Learning Capabilities:** This includes creating a vision for AI learning, facilitating knowledge exchange across companies, and infusing AI expertise within the organization.

The diagram shows that, in order to successfully implement AI, organizations need to develop a strong foundation in all four areas of AI capabilities. They need to have the right resources, the right processes, the right technologies, and the right governance in place. Only then will they be able to harness the full potential of AI to drive innovation and growth.","The proposed model was tested using a MASEM approach. We performed a multigroup analysis to examine parameter estimate differences between the monetization strategies. The results (see Table 6 and Fig. 2) suggest that the formation of WTP for freemium services differs in several ways according to the monetization strategy. As the research model is saturated, both models display a perfect fit (χ2 = 0; d.f. = 0; SRMR =.000; RMSEA =.000; CFI = 1.000; GFI = 1.000). For the “limited features” monetization strategy, the model explained 44.2% of the variance in trust and 50.5 % of the variance in WTP. For the “virtual items” monetization strategy, the model explained 20.9 % of the variance in trust and 40.0 % of the variance in WTP.Overall, the results of this meta-analysis highlight the differential roles of perceived value and trust in influencing WTP in the monetization strategies as all the paths differ significantly (see Table 6). Consequently, our findings confirm the moderating effect of the monetization strategy. In the context of virtual items, trust had a significant impact on WTP (β = .269, p < .05), whereas its impact for the “limited features” monetization strategy was non-significant, confirming H1. Consequently, we argue that trust mediates the effects of perceived value on WTP in the case of purchasing virtual items but does not have a similar role in the “limited features” monetization strategy. Thus, we highlight the importance of the direct effects of perceived value on WTP for the “limited features” monetization strategy, instead of mediation through trust.Our results underline the strong impact of functional value on WTP for the “limited features” monetization strategy (β = .673, p < .05). This path was non-significant for the “virtual items” monetization strategy. Therefore, H2 was confirmed. The impact of hedonic value on WTP was negative for the “limited features” monetization strategy (β = −.629, p < .05) and positive for the “virtual items” monetization strategy (β = .136, p < .05). Thus, H3 was confirmed. Interestingly, the impact of social value was stronger for the “limited features” monetization strategy (β = .562, p < .05) than it was for the “virtual items” monetization strategy (β = .122, p < .05). Thus, H4 was rejected. For price value, stronger effects on WTP were identified for the “limited features” monetization strategy (β = .425, p < .05) than were identified for the “virtual items” monetization strategy (β = .317, p < .05), confirming H5.Regarding the impact on trust, our findings underscore the role of functional value (β = .306, p < .05) and social value (β = .386, p < .05) for the “virtual items” monetization strategy. Thus, functional value and social value are shown to increase trust. Interestingly, the impact of hedonic value was non-significant and the impact of price value was weak and negative (β = −.078, p < .05). Thus, trust partially mediates the impact of social value and price value on WTP. For functional value, our results indicate full mediation. Since the path from trust to WTP for the “limited features” monetization strategy was identified as non-significant, the mechanism behind the impact of perceived value on WTP relies on direct effects.",29.95%,75.87%,77.74%,17.20%,80.20%

The interviews followed a semi-structured guide designed according to the main themes of Study 1. More specifically, the interviewees were asked to describe their recent experiences with freemium services and answer questions related to the perceived value of these services, perceptions regarding the service providers, and WTP for freemium services. The interview guide comprised three sections. The first part initiated with general inquiries, such as which freemium service interviewees utilized. The subsequent part involved questioning interviewees about the factors that lead them to pay for freemium services, aiming to capture their experiences with the service and discern the dimensions of perceived value. In the final section, interviewees were prompted to consider the significance of trust in their relationship with the service provider.We collected data for the two monetization strategies identified in Study 1—eight interviewees focused on services with limited features and seven interviewees focused on services relying on a “virtual items” selling strategy. We used a purposeful criterion sampling method to gain knowledge about the research topic (Patton, 2002, pp. 40–46). The interviews were conducted in Finland during October 2023 in quiet locations. The interviews were audio-recorded, and transcribed into text files, and translated from Finnish to English. The profile of our sample is presented in Table 7. The last interviews did not offer new insights, indicating data saturation (Namey et al., 2016).",0.00%,2.55%,76.74%,0.00%,42.50%

The main limitation is that we compared our conceptual model against two monetization strategies (limited features vs. virtual goods). However, several other forms of monetization have been presented. For example, Sciglimpaglia and Raafat (2022) emphasized adding in-service advertisements to free versions of services. Because of the limited data, we could not address the impact of in-service advertising on WTP for premium versions. Also, other aspects, such as the impact of the free-trial length, should be investigated.Based on the results of Study 2 (refer to Fig. 3), three future research propositions have been identified. Firstly, the link between functional value and price value was deemed significant within the context of a limited features monetization strategy. Subsequent research should explore how alterations in these dimensions impact each other's effectiveness. Secondly, the relationship between functional value and hedonic value appears significant across both monetization strategies. Future studies ought to examine how changes in functional value influence hedonic value and subsequently affect WTP for premium services. Thirdly, the type of service appears to influence the impact of perceived value dimensions on WTP for premium services. Consequently, future studies should investigate the moderating effect of service type.Finally, researchers expect that the service industry will be transformed in the future as consumers are shifting to the metaverse (Brüggemann and Lehmann-Zschunke, 2023, Wongkitrungrueng and Suprawan, 2023). More research will be needed from the viewpoint of its novel functionalities. For example, as Barreda and Shah (2023) have linked the metaverse with hyperconnectedness, the importance of social value might increase. In addition, the metaverse is expected to offer new opportunities for companies to promote physical products (Yoo et al., 2023). As this meta-analysis addressed selling virtual goods in virtual environments, future studies should examine selling physical goods in virtual environments.",4.62%,18.48%,68.24%,17.91%,78.19%

The reason is that they might not have been included in the initial proposal given their lack of a strictly direct relationship with operations in the agricultural sector. However, they will need to become involved in the project at some point, so it was considered helpful to include them in the initial proposal.2.The levels appear in a logical and understandable order. However, in reality, progress does not have to occur in that order (especially for Levels 4 to 9).3.Starting a project such as this one requires substantial funding from public and private initiatives. However, the radical changes in mindset required to discover and seize the opportunities provided by the MV, together with the need to safeguard its defining features (free and democratic), justify this public funding.4.Once these nine levels are complete, the reward is the creation of a community of MVs that use technology (augmented reality, mixed reality, and virtual worlds) to promote interaction, collaboration, and communication between different MVs of agricultural sector agents. The project deserves a name, and it has been denoted Interactive community: A carrot in the metaverse (MVC-Carrot).5.This proposal is the first phase of a scalable project that should continue by linking the MVC-Carrot with other MV communities related to this or other sectors. Such a process would make sense of what is known as the “MV economy”.",23.47%,58.75%,80.59%,5.86%,82.78%
31,h38.png," The table summarizes the steps taken in this study to develop and validate a measurement instrument for assessing the explainability of artificial intelligence (AI) applications. 

In the first step, a literature review was conducted to identify existing work on explainability in AI. 

This review led to the adoption of the following five XAI objectives as measures of explainability: 
1. confidence to stability, 
2. fairness, 
3. accessibility, 
4. interactivity, and 
5. confidentiality and privacy.  

In the second step, these five objectives were used to develop a 20-item questionnaire. 

This questionnaire was then pre-tested with 20 practicing IT leaders who had experience working with XAI. 

The feedback from this pre-test was used to refine the questionnaire, resulting in a final version that consisted of 15 items. 

In the third step, the final version of the questionnaire was used to collect data from a larger sample of IT leaders (n=100). 

The data was analyzed using a variety of statistical techniques, including exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis. 

The results of this analysis supported the reliability and validity of the questionnaire, indicating that it is a useful tool for assessing the explainability of AI applications.","To analyse the data, we followed a thematic approach to identifying relevant patterns and themes (Braun & Clarke, 2006). A theoretical coding process was carried out, using an abductive approach based on the framework of reference (Dubois & Gadde, 2002). The coding process was rather iterative, going back and forth between the theory and the collected data (Gioia et al., 2013). This method provides consistent and rigorous analysis across three iterative stages of data analysis, following the approach commonly undertaken in case studies (Yin, 2014). With the support of NVIVO software, data were coded to identify prominent themes that helped us to glean important insights from the phenomenon under observation. This process was conducted through a within-case analysis for each SME, followed by a cross-case analysis with the continuous identification of how SME resource orchestration supports AI implementation as the company makes its digital transformation (Beverland & Lindgreen, 2010). Fig. 1 depicts the data analysis process developed in three stages (Gioia et al., 2013).The first step in data analysis involved a thorough reading and familiarisation with the interview transcripts. We read and coded the collected data, including interview transcripts, meeting notes, and internal documents. The utilised software facilitated the coding process by identifying common phrases retrieved from verbatim quotations, resulting in first-order categories. In this step, we identified information related to resources, capabilities, and leveraging AI applications, as well as valuable outcomes. We identified the emerging codes that most accurately represented the participants’ voices (14 elements). The second step consisted of recognising patterns in the first-order categories through an iterative process between the theory and the data, leading to the generation of second-order themes that allowed a higher level of abstraction. Here, we conceptualised the first-order codes into seven themes. This step was facilitated by thorough discussions of the data, which then led to the third step. This final step involved the generation of aggregate dimensions. We categorised the seven themes into three dimensions: structuring AI resources, bundling AI capabilities, and leveraging AI resources and capabilities. These three dimensions served as the basis for our analysis.",61.27%,95.64%,81.95%,27.87%,85.11%
32,h39.png," The table shows the factor correlation between four constructs: business process agility, AI applications portfolio update capability, performance, and explainability. The correlation coefficients range from 0.44 to 0.90, which indicates that the constructs are moderately to highly correlated. This suggests that the constructs are related to each other and that they may be measuring similar underlying dimensions.

The highest correlation is between performance and explainability (0.90), which suggests that these two constructs are very closely related. This may be because both constructs are related to the ability of a company to understand and improve its performance. The second highest correlation is between business process agility and performance (0.73), which suggests that these two constructs are also closely related. This may be because both constructs are related to the ability of a company to adapt to changes in its environment.

The third highest correlation is between AI applications portfolio update capability and performance (0.49), which suggests that these two constructs are somewhat related. This may be because AI applications can help companies to improve their performance by automating tasks and providing insights into data. The lowest correlation is between business process agility and AI applications portfolio update capability (0.44), which suggests that these two constructs are not as closely related as the other constructs. This may be because business process agility is more focused on the ability of a company to adapt to changes in its environment, while AI applications portfolio update capability is more focused on the ability of a company to use AI to improve its performance.

Overall, the factor correlation table shows that the four constructs are related to each other, but they are not perfectly correlated. This suggests that the constructs are measuring different aspects of a company's performance.","Based on the empirical results of our study, we observed that manufacturing SMEs implement AI through a process that requires them to identify resources and capabilities before leveraging them and converting them into competitive advantage and value for the customer. Following our observations of the case companies, we propose a process framework on how SMEs implement AI in their manufacturing processes as part of their digital transformation (Fig. 2). The framework illustrates how SMEs can proceed through three different phases of the AI implementation process: (1) structuring an AI resources portfolio, (2) bundling AI capabilities, and (3) leveraging AI resources and capabilities by mobilising technologies, coordinating processes, and leveraging people. Because this digital transformation depends on the capacity to leverage and intertwine AI resources and capabilities, SMEs can use this framework to assist them in their AI transformation path.During the first phase, SMEs focus on “structuring AI resources”, where they identify the relevant resources for AI implementation. These are both tangible and intangible resources – namely, data resources, infrastructure resources, human resources, and capital resources, all of which are important for organisational capabilities. The companies have developed better use of data, invested in new systems, recruited new people with the right skills, and trained employees to better understand data. Moreover, these companies were able to trigger innovation by moving down the AI path.In the second phase, manufacturing SMEs concentrate on “bundling AI capabilities”. The logic is that by building AI resources, SMEs are able to identify current AI capabilities (e.g., big data analytics, which is used to optimise production, plan, and forecast) or to earmark which new capabilities are needed (i.e., recommendation systems and churn analysis). By bundling AI capabilities, SMEs are able to progressively develop a greater understanding of AI technologies while promoting inter-organisational knowledge exchange. In particular, SMEs developed portfolios of projects that enabled them to identify areas that could benefit from AI technologies, determine the feasibility of each project, and estimate the return on investment. Analytics from data, relevant competencies, capital, and infrastructure resources increasingly become crucial resources to bundle AI capabilities.The final phase is “leveraging AI resources and capabilities” where SMEs integrate both capabilities and resources to implement AI in the best possible way and to obtain measurable outcomes to gain a competitive advantage. During this phase, AI capabilities should be scaled up and interchangeably evolved, grown, and expanded, resulting in leveraged gains. These capabilities are linked to organisational performance and value creation resulting from AI. AI implementation is aimed at improving the internal processes of SMEs and enabling them to gain a competitive advantage. Through incremental transformation, SMEs are deploying AI technologies as part of their daily operations. AI has enhanced efficiency in production, operation, and optimisation processes. Data, as part of the foundational decision-making process, has progressively become more important, as has leveraging AI resources and capabilities for employees’ empowerment, learning, and education. We observe that the transformation of SMEs results from the complex interplay of resources given organisational structures and processes. For SMEs, AI implementation is a journey to improve performance by reducing unexpected breakdowns, interruptions, and costs. Achieving this is accomplished by making use of AI technologies that are easy to implement and by building on current capabilities that allow for improved efficiency of the production processes.",39.94%,96.41%,81.01%,24.29%,84.11%

Study 2 contributes to our analysis in that it examines the dynamic environment within which organisations operate, their customers, and their business value. The analysed SMEs and SHC try to align their resources and capabilities so that they can provide value to their customers whilst ensuring the sustainability and profitability of their businesses.A central lesson on framework refinement refers to customer value creation as the main outcome sought from AI resource orchestration capabilities. According to the respondents, providing value to customers is a fundamental objective, and AI plays a significant role in this process. The SMEs mentioned the possibility of increasing sales and revenue when resources are allocated to AI projects by engaging customers and enabling data-driven decision-making that aligns with their customer preferences. Alpha’s CFO clearly illustrated this point:“It would have been cool to find something like you said, something that creates customer value, so our clients feel like, wow, this was cool, I’d pay for it. As a result, you become more competitive and more attractive as a supplier.”In addition, Alpha’s head of marketing and sales excellence asserted:“We are perhaps most passionate about production-driven customer offers, so it is also more customer-focused than cost-oriented. It is also possible that we have a forecast that only some customers will order. We say that we have a decent order forecast, then we know that a customer will order something within a month, and this fits well into II Production Planning within 2 weeks. The customer will receive an offer with a reduced price if they order this now, and it will be easier to plan production if they do.”The statement above shows AI implementation by SMEs in the manufacturing industry as part of their digital transformation process. These observations provide feedback for further refinement of the proposed framework for AI implementation. The study validation shows how SMEs manage AI resources and bundle their existing capabilities, maximising the potential of resources and capabilities that their organisation processes. This is a dynamic flux of continuous modifications and enhancements (or acquisitions) of existing structures, which create or renew capacities to leverage AI implementation.

34,h40.png," The table shows the results of a regression analysis. The dependent variable is performance. The independent variables are AI applications portfolio update capability, business process agility, and the interaction between AI applications portfolio update capability and explainability. The control variables are size of firm, public/private/not-for-profit, main line of business, and tenure with the company.

The results show that AI applications portfolio update capability has a significant positive effect on performance (β = 0.41, p < 0.001). Business process agility also has a significant positive effect on performance (β = 0.36, p < 0.05). The interaction between AI applications portfolio update capability and explainability does not have a significant effect on performance (β = 0.07, p > 0.05).

Of the control variables, only size of firm has a significant effect on performance, with larger firms having higher performance (β = 0.09, p < 0.05).

The model explains 78% of the variance in performance.","In information systems literature, the terms interpretability and explainability have multiple definitions are sometimes used interchangeably. We define interpretability of an AI-system as a characteristic indicating whether an individual is able to understand the full decision-making process of an AI (Guidotti et al., 2018, Rudin, 2019). Table 1 presents different definitions in literature for explainability and compares them with interpreterability.As shown in Table 1, the literature reveals a lack of consensus regarding the definitions of explainability. To gain insight into the lack of consensus, it would be worthwhile to consider the definition of XAI provided by Gunning et al., 2019 defining XAI as a suite of AI techniques that enables human users to understand, and effectively manage the emerging generation of artificially intelligent partners (Gunning et al., 2019). While this definition incorporates the essential concept of understanding, it fails to account for other significant purposes that drive the demand for XAI models. We will explore these aspects further in the subsequent discussion, highlighting them as evidence of the definition’s incompleteness.Definition of explanation is essential to understanding XAI. According to the Cambridge Dictionary for English, an explanation refers to ""the details or reasons that someone gives to make something clear or easy to understand"". In the context of AI, this can be restated as “the details or reasons that an AI system provides to clarify or simplify its outcome."" However, in this definition, two ambiguities emerge. First, the reasons used for explanation are entirely contingent on the audience to whom they are presented. Second, whether the explanation effectively renders the concept clear or easy to understand also relies entirely on the audience. The definition needs to be reformulated to account for the audience of a given XAI. A revised definition presented by (Arrieta et al., 2020) defines explainability as follows:Given a certain audience, explainability refers to the details and reasons a model gives to make its functioning clear or easy to understand."".(Arrieta et al., 2020)’s perspective on explainability aligns with the definition given by (Herm et al., 2023) that looks at the construct as a perceived quality of explanation of functional effectiveness. In essence both these two definitions involve the use of logical-based formalizations of arguments to persuade or convince an audience even though it poses a significant challenge (Besnard & Hunter, 2008). However, it is possible to objectively assess the extent to which the internals of an AI system can be explained. Any method that reduces the complexity of the AI model used or simplifies its outputs can be deemed as an XAI approach. The degree of complexity or simplicity achieved in this process determines the explainability.

The table highlights two promising areas for expanding upon existing research. First, the current body of literature focuses on functional competencies, specifically those related to AI infrastructure and associated management capabilities. Simultaneously, AI infrastructure is increasingly becoming a standardized commodity, and AI applications that offer differentiation tend to depreciate rapidly due to shifts in the market. Realizing the benefits of AI under these conditions requires continuous efforts to construct and maintain a portfolio of AI applications. Prior research highlights the significance of updating AI applications portfolio as a dynamic capability for adapting to evolving market conditions and enhancing firm performance. Drawing from this discussion, we propose that a firm's ability to refresh its portfolio of AI applications stands as a critical driver of its overall performance",28.42%,51.82%,80.93%,29.88%,73.67%
36,h42.png," The table shows the results of a study that examined the relationship between the use of agile development practices and the perceived security of software systems. The results show that the use of agile practices is associated with a higher level of perceived security in three out of four security dimensions: confidence, accessibility, and interactivity. However, there is no significant relationship between agile practices and perceived privacy and confidentiality.

The study was conducted using a survey of software developers who were asked to rate the security of their systems using a five-point scale. The survey also included questions about the use of agile development practices. The results were analyzed using a multiple regression analysis.

The findings of this study suggest that the use of agile development practices can help to improve the perceived security of software systems. This is likely because agile practices emphasize collaboration, communication, and feedback, which can help to identify and address security risks early in the development process.",The consistency observed between these two studies enhances the generalizability of our findings.

Appendix item 1 contains the questions, the corresponding variables they represent, and the source supporting the operationalization of the variable. These latent variables include AAPUC, process agility and firm performance. To measure AAPUC, we used established literature that describes how companies update their resource portfolios through three key actions: (a) acquiring resources, (b) developing resources internally, and (c) discontinuing legacy resources (Sirmon et al., 2011, Sirmon et al., 2007). In the context of IT resources, it is argued that certain companies excel in obtaining valuable IT applications from suppliers (Tanriverdi, 2006), while their abilities for in-house IT application development or discontinuation of legacy IT applications may be limited (Lee and Xia, 2010, van Oosterhout et al., 2006). Consequently, our operationalization of AI applications portfolio update capability employs formative items that collectively define the construct, departing from reflective items used when each indicator is an ""imperfect reflection of the construct"" (MacKenzie et al., 2011). In essence, the three competences of acquiring, developing and discontinuing AI applications comprehensively characterize AAPUC. Thus, our measurement as presented in Appendix A involves formative items that relate to those competences in relation to AI applications. We also developed measures for explainability of AI following the three-stage process posited by (Boateng et al., 2018), presented in Table 5.",3.28%,72.60%,74.97%,15.17%,73.64%

Although our questionnaire was constructed utilizing preexisting instruments in the literature as well as inputs and pre-test from experts, we evaluated our instrument as a new measure that requires checking of unidimensionality. Unidimensionality tests whether all items measured in a metric contribute to measurement of the construct under study (Gerbing & Anderson, 1988). Since PLS does not measure for unidimensionality, we used SPSS to carry out a scree test (B. D’agostino Sr and Russell, 2014) to determine the number of latent constructs on the dataset. Then we used smartPLS to examine the questionnaire’s items for loading, weights, validity, and reliability. Table 6 presents the results of the factor analysis of our constructs.We assessed construct-to-item loadings for our reflective constructs to see if item loadings were sufficient to include an item under a specific construct. Only item loadings that exceeded 0.70 were retained (Hair et al., 2011), which is consistent with the results of the scree test before and after the loading test. Next, we measured composite reliability for each reflective construct to assess internal consistency (Raykov, 1998). In early research development, reliability scores above 0.70 are acceptable, whereas 0.80 is recommended for established constructs (Nunnally, 1978, Werts et al., 1978). Table 6 shows our constructs’ validity, reliability, and correlation matrix. Each construct’s dependability exceeds 0.70. In Table 6 the square root of AVE is bigger than off-diagonal correlations. To assess the validity of constructs, we compared the square root of AVE with correlation between each pair of constructs (Fornell & Larcker, 1981). Table 6 shows that for each construct, the square root of AVE is greater than their off-diagonal correlation of that construct. In order to avoid product unstable path estimates, we ran several Variance Inflation Factors tests that all returned a maximum of 2.1 while the threshold of concerns is 10 for reflective constructs (MacKenzie et al., 2011).

We used four measures for explainability of artificial intelligence applications within firms, as follows: (1) confidence to stability and reliability, (2) accessibility, (3) interactivity, (4) privacy and confidentiality. We investigated the variations in the performance outcomes of AAPUC as firms focused on different characteristics of XAI. In order to accomplish this, we applied Hayes (2013) regression-based method to test conditional effects (Hayes, 2013). This approach enables us to investigate how the impact of AAPUC varies depending on the different focuses of firms on characteristics of XAI. It also allows us to generate confidence intervals to assess the effects of AAPUC across different XAI characteristics. We estimated two models using the PROCESS macro for SPSS with 1000 bootstrap samples (Preacher & Hayes, 2008). The initial model examines the impact of AAPUC on firm performance without considering agility as the mediator in the analysis. The second model assesses the effects of AAPUC while controlling for the influence of agility.The findings presented in Table 5 indicate that AAPUC has a significantly positive impact on the performance of firms focusing on accessibility (β: 0.21, ρ = 0.03) and interactivity (β: 0.25, ρ = 0.01) of AI applications and not confidence or privacy and confidentiality, but only when agility is not considered in the analysis. However, when accounting for the influence of agility, the effects of AAPUC are not statistically significant, as presented in Table 8. This underscores the importance of identifying and considering mediators like agility and other variables that may influence the relationship between AAPUC and performance. The additional analysis results in Table 8 align with our discussion on the importance of agility as a mediator for the relationship between AAPUC and performance. The analysis also highlights the more significant role of accessibility and interactivity in the direct effect of AAPUC on performance.",5.53%,61.10%,74.46%,3.67%,65.19%

The sample group was seven (7) IT managers at a high administrative level within their organizations (c-level executives) who have experience with updating their portfolio of AI applications and have adopted or plan to adopt XAI. The sample group focused on individuals with knowledge of XAI. The rationale for this sampling decision is that individuals need to demonstrate a knowledge of XAI to provide informed responses to the qualitative survey. The overlap between managerial practitioners with knowledge of XAI and a desire to adopt the technology is sizeable, the 7 individuals we interviewed happened to fit both criteria. However, we acknowledge that there are individuals that are aware of XAI but have no plans to adopt it within their organizations. We have acknowledged this shortcoming in the limitations of this study in Section 6.3. The seven participants were not involved in the previous quantitative survey.

43,h49.png," The table shows the fit indices for four different structural equation models. The first model is the proposed structural model, which includes all of the hypothesized relationships between the constructs. The second model is a restricted model in which the relationship between social media use and service innovation is removed. The third model is a restricted model in which the relationship between service innovation and organizational resilience is removed. The fourth model is a restricted model in which the relationship between organizational resilience and organizational performance is removed.

The fit indices show that the proposed structural model fits the data better than the restricted models. The proposed structural model has the lowest chi-square value, the lowest RMSEA value, the lowest ECVI value, and the lowest AIC value. This suggests that the proposed structural model is the best-fitting model for the data.

The NCP value is a measure of the parsimony of the model. The NCP value is calculated by dividing the number of degrees of freedom by the number of parameters in the model. The lower the NCP value, the more parsimonious the model. The proposed structural model has the lowest NCP value, which suggests that it is the most parsimonious model.

Overall, the fit indices suggest that the proposed structural model is the best-fitting and most parsimonious model for the data.","Recent literature highlights the critical role of digital technologies, especially SM tools, in promoting innovation activities in changing environments (Muninger et al., 2022). Various studies have drawn on DC theory to describe the crucial role of SM use in improving firms’ sensing and seizing capabilities. These platforms enable organizations to capture valuable knowledge, shape business opportunities, and develop new products from the “sensed” opportunities in response to market trends (Mention et al., 2019, Warner and Wager, 2019). SM enable firms to connect with their customers and receive valuable feedback to improve existing products and services, thereby enhancing innovation processes (Dwivedi et al., 2021a). SM use thus enables and drives service innovation by stimulating companies to scan the environment and gather external information. SM also support collaboration and knowledge flows to help firms implement and benefit from their steps toward innovation (Bhimani et al., 2019).Recent studies confirm empirically the relevant impact of SM technologies in fostering service innovation. Analyzing firms from different sectors, Borah et al. (2022) observed that SM use positively and significantly affected firm innovation capabilities. Latifah et al. (2022) confirmed that SM tools support knowledge sharing among young entrepreneurs, leading to better innovation performance. Rakshit et al. (2021) found SM networks to be a useful external knowledge source supporting new product development during the pandemic. Based on the foregoing, Hypothesis 1 is proposed:H1Social media use positively affects service innovation.In today’s complex and uncertain environment, companies must participate in collaborative networks to work with partners and gain valuable resources (Xie et al., 2022). Collaborative innovation is especially important in the service industry, where intense competition makes collaboration with customers and suppliers a key relational asset for companies’ innovation (Wang et al., 2016). In fact, business networks contributed significantly to companies’ adaptation during the Covid-19 pandemic by providing access to external resources, including knowledge (Xie et al., 2022).Digital technologies, and especially SM tools, facilitate continuous knowledge sharing through multiple connections across organizational boundaries, enabling networking and collaboration (Kwayu et al., 2021). SM platforms enrich interactions and promote information sharing in a collaborative participatory approach, giving firms up-to-date knowledge from key stakeholders such as customers, partners, and suppliers (Dwivedi et al., 2021a, Wu et al., 2022). Recent literature stresses SM technologies’ role in enabling network interactions and facilitating knowledge sharing among network members (Muninger et al., 2022). In this vein, Corral de Zubielqui et al. (2019) demonstrated empirically that companies’ SM use enabled multiple connections with market-based actors (suppliers, customers, consultants), providing firms with valuable external knowledge flows. Similarly, Cepeda-Carrion et al. (2023) analyzed a sample of service firms to show the value of SM tools as a means of communication linking firms to important stakeholders, facilitating rapid coordinated response to market changes by developing new services. Thus, Hypothesis 2 is proposed:H2Social media use positively affects collaboration networks.Competing in dynamic environments requires constant adaptation to and generation of innovative ideas (Markovic et al., 2021). To this end, organizations have increased knowledge acquisition from external sources to accelerate innovation processes (Natalicchio et al., 2018). External collaboration provides additional expertise to complement firms’ internal base, encouraging development of innovations (Nieves & Diaz-Meneses, 2018). In fact, service innovations are more dependent than product innovation on external knowledge and collaboration, and require deeper involvement of firms’ customers and other service ecosystem partners (Lütjen et al., 2019).By joining networks, firms can collaborate with a wide range of stakeholders and share important knowledge for effective innovation (Corral de Zubielqui et al., 2019). Customers are key external partners who can provide critical insights through participation in co-creation activities, helping companies develop services that meet changing market needs (Ozanne et al., 2022). Collaboration with suppliers can assist firms in innovation processes by building on their distinctive expertise and knowledge of materials and techniques (Corral de Zubielqui et al., 2019). Even competitors become critical innovation partners, as they can provide essential complementary resources and participate in joint projects (Markovic et al., 2021).Exploitation of external knowledge sources across a firm’s borders to generate new ideas, products, or services may be a critical antecedent of the dynamic capability to innovate (Dovbischuk, 2022). In this vein, Lütjen et al. (2019) demonstrated empirically that external relationships with different cooperation partners played an essential role in successful development of service innovations. Similarly, Natalicchio et al. (2018) confirmed that externally acquired knowledge positively impacted the firm’s innovation outcomes. Therefore, it is suggested that:H3Collaboration networks positively affect service innovation.Organizational resilience is a dynamic capability that helps firms respond to disruptions in time to recover cost-effectively and even improve over the organization’s pre-disruption state (Dovbischuk, 2022). Such resilience enables organizations to adapt and persist in the face of disruptions. Resilient organizations are agile, robust, well-integrated, and coherent. Organizational resilience is thus a key capability when firms face growing uncertainty in their business environment (Xie et al., 2022).Service innovation also involves novel market or company services, changes in or extensions of service or delivery processes, and repositioning of services (Avlonitis et al., 2001). The ability to innovate contributes to firms’ identification and understanding of novel ideas to solve problems, helping firms to better address external disruptions. Firms with greater capacity to innovate will thus achieve a higher level of organizational resilience (Dovbischuk, 2022).Examining a sample of service firms during the pandemic, Li et al. (2021) confirmed that service innovation is important to firms’ survival and generation of resilience in the face of external disruptions. Dovbischuk (2022) confirmed empirically a positive association of innovation capabilities with a higher level of dynamic resilience among logistics service providers. Based on the above, it can be assumed that organizations that engage in more service innovation are more resistant to disruption and can adapt more quickly to their competitive context to overcome uncertainty. In so doing, they also become more resilient. The foregoing evidence suggests thatH4Service innovation positively affects organizational resilience.
Service innovation is critical to service organizations’ success because the environment in which they function and compete is always evolving (Newey & Zahra, 2009). Service organizations have typically included service innovation among their strategic objectives (Li et al., 2021). Such innovation is essential to coping successfully with volatile environments because it enables organizations to maintain and improve performance in the face of disruptive events (Dovbischuk, 2022).Extensive prior literature has confirmed that innovation-oriented service organizations perform and compete better (Bustinza et al., 2019, Li et al., 2021, So et al., 2023). Firms that adopt innovative approaches are more likely to find and exploit opportunities (new products, services, processes), contribute to revolutionizing service industry structures and contingencies in business models, and generate organizational growth processes (Dwivedi et al., 2022, Niemimaa et al., 2019), thus stimulating organizational growth (Covin and Slevin, 1991, Martín-Rojas et al., 2017). Not encouraging innovative activities negatively impacts organizations’ productivity and performance. These negative effects are especially harmful to service organizations, while more service innovation helps these firms increase customer satisfaction, advocacy, and desired loyalty behavior; and to find strategies that enhance brand image, reduce costs, and facilitate product and service delivery (Li et al., 2021, So et al., 2023).Examining previous studies on the topic, So et al. (2023) concluded that organizational innovation efforts enhance financial and market performance both directly and indirectly in the context of service firms. This finding leads to the following hypothesisH5Service innovation positively affects organizational performance.Building on DC theory, our study considers organizational resilience as a DC that enables firms to adapt better to their environment and tackle challenges more successfully (Beuren et al., 2022). Organizational resilience improves performance and business success, enabling organizations to emerge strengthened from challenges and external disruptions (Hollands et al., 2023).When resilient organizations face uncertainty and instability, they outperform competitors and adapt to exploit new opportunities and gain competitive advantages (Hillmann & Guenther, 2021). Resilient organizations achieve their goal better, adapting more quickly to changing environments because they can face the uncertain future with creativity and optimism (Ayala and Manzano, 2010, Do et al., 2022). Resilience capability thus reduces the effects of disruptions through proactive response strategies, reconfigured processes, and optimal responses to environmental changes (Beuren et al., 2022), enabling resilient firms to perform better in disruptive situations (Anwar et al., 2023).Recent empirical research has confirmed this relationship. Dovbischuk (2022) observed that a higher level of dynamic resilience was positively associated with better firm performance. Similarly, Pratono et al. (2022) confirmed empirically that organizational resilience exerted the strongest influence on competitive advantage, measured in terms of financial performance. It is therefore proposed thatH6Organizational resilience positively affects organizational performance.",22.13%,83.93%,78.70%,0.29%,89.26%

First, a preliminary structured questionnaire was developed based on existing literature. Several company directors, academics and consultants were then interviewed to check the comprehensibility of the items and to ensure appropriate content and wording. Based on suggestions from the experts consulted in the pretest, the questionnaire was revised to incorporate the recommended changes and obtain the final questionnaire, which examined how organizations handle these strategic issues.General managers were selected as strategic informants because they lead departmental strategy design, and plan and direct the organization’s future actions (Westphal & Fredickson, 2001). Drawing on information from the different departments, these CEOs steer strategic activity to enhance performance (Baer & Frese, 2002).Using the Iberian Balance Sheet Analysis Systems (SABI) database and information from Spain’s Ministry of Science and Research, the Andalusian regional government, and the Ministry of Economy, Innovation and Science, an accurate list of Spanish tourism firms was compiled to identify the study population.

In the experiment, participants were randomly allocated into one of two priming conditions (maximisers = 62 and satisficers = 61).Prior to data collection, participants were presented with a participant information statement, which outlined the study’s goals and procedures. They were provided with an explanation of the omnichannel concept. Those who expressed their interest in participating were asked to read and sign a consent form and complete the demographic information section.Participants were first presented with a priming task to induce a specific decision-making style (maximiser or satisficer). We used the priming technique recommended by Ma and Roese (2014) and Mao (2016). The priming task consisted of five questions asking participants to choose either the ‘best’ or the ‘good enough’ option among five alternative choices. For example, in the maximiser condition, participants were asked Please choose the country you think is the best place to visit: A. Belgium, B. Denmark, C. The Netherlands, D. Norway, E. Sweden’. In the satisficers condition, participants were asked: ‘Please choose the countries you think would be acceptable to visit: A. Belgium, B. Denmark, C. The Netherlands, D. Norway, E. Sweden’.After completing the priming task, participants were presented with a shopping scenario in which they were given a shopping task (buying a new pair of sunglasses), asked to search various digital channels and touchpoints and asked to select a product of their preference. To replicate the dynamic nature of omnichannel shopping, participants were provided with a real-world omnichannel sunglasses store. They were also provided with multiple digital channel links that were integrated to represent an omnichannel setup. Participants were free to explore these links based on their interests and preferences. After completing their shopping task, participants were asked to return to the questionnaire and reflect on their omnichannel shopping experience.Perceived omnichannel interaction quality was measured using six items adapted from Lee et al. (2019) and Sousa and Voss (2006). Participants responded to all items using a seven-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). For each participant, all six items were analysed and collapsed into a single factor using factor analysis.To evaluate individuals’ propensity to maximise or satisfice decisions, several scales have been advanced by various authors (Dalal et al., 2015, Diab et al., 2008, Nenkov et al., 2008, Schwartz et al., 2002). For this study, and all subsequent studies, the maximising tendency scale (MTS) was utilised to confirm the success of the priming task. The MTS consists of nine items originally developed by Diab et al. (2008), and it has been recommended as the most appropriate measure of decision-making styles (maximising versus satisficing) (Cheek & Schwartz, 2016). The scale items were derived from previous research and adapted to suit the context of the omnichannel study. For example, participants were asked to rate their agreement with statements such as ‘No matter what it takes, I always try to choose the best options for me’ and ‘I was not willing to settle for “good enough” while I was shopping for my new sunglasses’. Participants responded to the nine items using a seven-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). For each participant, MTS measures were merged using factor analysis to collapse all nine items into one. Higher MTS scores reflected a stronger tendency to maximise, whereas lower scores reflected a tendency to satisfice. Thus, MTS was applied to all studies as the manipulation check tool.",22.84%,74.06%,77.49%,18.98%,83.12%

**Study sample**: The subset of the target population that is actually studied.

**Descriptive or analytical**: The study sample can be used to describe the characteristics of the target population or to test hypotheses about the relationships between variables.

**Single data collection or repeated data collection with multiple participants**: The study sample can be collected at one time point or over multiple time points.

**Qualitative or quantitative**: The study sample can be used to collect qualitative data (e.g., interviews, observations) or quantitative data (e.g., surveys, experiments).","A cross-sectional study, also known as a prevalence or transverse study, uses a snapshot of participants’ beliefs, behaviors, or other variables of interest of a study population (e.g., a group of individuals or organizations) at a specified point in time (Grimes and Schulz, 2002, Hua and David, 2008) to examine research questions (see Fig. 1).Descriptive and analytical approaches are commonly used in cross-sectional studies (Kesmodel, 2018, Wang and Cheng, 2020). Descriptive cross-sectional studies aim to characterize and assess the prevalence or distribution of one or more variables of interest in a population (Aggarwal & Ranganathan, 2019). Analytical cross-sectional studies use multiple variables to measure their association within a population using independent samples drawn at different points in time (Ranganathan & Aggarwal, 2019).Cross-sectional studies can employ single or multiple waves – in that case, with different participants1 – of data collection (Wang & Cheng, 2020). Many studies draw inferences based on the analysis of single cross-sectional data. Others make inferences based on analysis of repeated cross-sectional data gathered using surveys administered at successive points in time. This design is called 'pseudo-longitudinal' when the same tools are used to gather data in waves from different participants (Pan, 2021). When collecting data once per month, for example, participants who complete the first cross-sectional survey will not be the same as participants the following month. Such studies can track the prevalence of a variable (e.g., disease) in the population over time. 
Cross-sectional data can be gathered using qualitative or quantitative techniques (Cummings, 2017). This implies that data are collected, for example, through interviews, focus groups, or questionnaires, and are then further analyzed using regression-based or configurational methods.",42.46%,71.65%,82.32%,13.78%,87.59%
53,h101.jpg," The figure shows the strengths and limitations of cross-sectional data, as well as when not to use it.

Strengths:
- Execution is efficient and inexpensive
- Uses the whole dataset
- Simple sampling strategy

Limitations:
- Methodological and statistical limitations
- Sources of bias, e.g. selection bias, information bias, confounding

When not to use cross-sectional data:
- When needing to test hypotheses with temporal relationships","Each cross-sectional approach has strengths and limitations (Fig. 2). We pair these strengths and limitations to offer guidance on when using cross-sectional data is or is not appropriate.The strengths of cross-sectional data help to explain their overuse in IS research. First, such studies can be conducted efficiently and inexpensively by distributing a survey to a convenient sample (e.g., the researcher’s social network or students) (Compeau et al., 2012) or by using a crowdsourcing website (Lowry et al., 2016, Steelman et al., 2014). Second, using a single cross-sectional design renders collecting all data relatively simple and frees the researcher from worrying about attrition, such that the whole data set can be assembled quickly. While other types of studies (e.g., cohort study) require the selection of participants based on specific criteria (e.g., depending on participants’ status), many cross-sectional studies’ sampling strategy involves randomly drawing participants from a target population that is relevant for a research study (Martínez-Mesa et al., 2016). These benefits and strengths are illustrated in four use cases for when to use data gathered using cross-sectional techniques.The first use case for cross-sectional studies is the provision of baseline information to justify the need for further research on a given topic (Setia, 2016). Findings from such studies might be used to lay a foundation for more sophisticated follow-up studies or to generate possible hypotheses. Such initial insight helps inform studies of emerging issues or evolving trends, such as the metaverse (Dwivedi, Hughes, Baabdullah et al., 2022), impact of digital technologies on climate change (Dwivedi, Hughes, & Kar et al., 2022) or blockchain applications (Yli-Huumo et al., 2016). For example, as Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies gathered media attention, research examined variance in investment motivations (Mattke, Maier, Reis et al., 2021), using cross-sectional data to identify different motivations driving the phenomenon. In such cases, cross-sectional data helps inform the design of future research on the phenomena and additional rounds of data collection (e.g., longitudinal data).A second use case is to establish the prevalence of perceptions or behaviors (Kesmodel, 2018, Lu, 2009). Cross-sectional studies offer insights into the distribution of variables of interest (e.g., pathological technology use, computer anxiety) which is vital for understanding the impact of a problem within a given target population. For example, one study established the proportion of users who report technostress also report health complaints (e.g., headaches, fatigue) (Gimpel et al., 2018). In that way, such studies can describe the frequency and importance of a problem.A third use case is estimating (non-temporal) associations between variables. Cross-sectional studies reveal how variables are associated with others. For example, research has identified differences between individuals using the social networking site Facebook and those not using it (Ryan & Xenos, 2011). Another study has shown that IT professionals perceive blurring boundaries and work-home conflict as stressful, while non-IT professionals associate these factors less strongly with perceived stress (Maier et al., 2015).A fourth and final use case for cross-sectional studies is comparison. Data from such studies help develop new measures or scales (Compeau et al., 2022), as research might investigate the accuracy of such measurements when comparing new and old measures or establish the factor structure of a measurement model. Similarly, cross-sectional studies offer valuable insights, particularly when paired with data from different sources (e.g., subjective, perceptual data from surveys, and objective data collected during an experiment) to study their association (Junco, 2013, Tams et al., 2014).",40.74%,86.43%,81.77%,0.03%,87.26%

The 12-item Need for Touch (NFT) scale, which is divided into autotelic and instrumental need for touch, comes from Peck and Childers (2003a), and the four-item scale for measuring imagination is based on Johnson (2014). We use a seven-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 = Strongly disagree to 7 = Strongly agree, to measure the constructs of telepresence and imagination, and a scale ranging from -3 = Strongly disagree to 3 = Strongly agree to measure the need for touch. When measuring the attitude toward virtual shopping, we use a seven-point semantic differential scale ranging from negative to positive, dislike to like, and favorable to unfavorable.

Cronbach’s alpha (α) and composite reliability (CR) scores both indicate appropriate reliability (Fornell & Larcker, 1981), and all factor loadings are statistically significant (p < 0.001) and greater than the generally considered threshold of 0.70 (Appendix A) (e.g., (Hair et al., 2019). Further, the average variance extracted (AVE) values are all greater than 0.6, supporting convergent validity, and the square roots of AVE values exceed the between-construct correlations (Table 3), supporting discriminant validity (Fornell & Larcker, 1981). Given the study’s cross-sectional nature, we controlled for common method variance in the study design before the data collection and by using statistical procedures after the data collection (Chang et al., 2010, Podsakoff et al., 2003). To control for the common method variance during the data collection, we used differently coded scales (semantic differential and Likert scales), reverse coded questions and protected the respondents’ anonymity, as suggested by Podsakoff et al. (2003). As for the statistical procedures, we used the CFA marker technique approach (Lindell and Whitney, 2001, Williams et al., 2010) with a theoretically unrelated questionnaire item stating “I like blue clothes” as the marker variable (Miller & Chiodo, 2008). The results show that study variables have low and non-significant correlations (0.062–0.115) with the marker variable, indicating that common method bias should not be a concern.

The factors are perceived social influence, perceived performance expectancy, perceived effort expectancy, hedonic motivation, anthropomorphism, and emotion. The arrows between the factors show the direction of the relationship. For example, the arrow from perceived social influence to emotion shows that perceived social influence has a positive effect on emotion. This means that if a person perceives that others are using AI devices, they are more likely to feel positive emotions about using AI devices themselves. The model suggests that perceived social influence, perceived performance expectancy, perceived effort expectancy, hedonic motivation, and anthropomorphism all have a positive effect on emotion, which in turn has a positive effect on a person's willingness to use AI devices. The model also suggests that perceived social influence, perceived performance expectancy, perceived effort expectancy, hedonic motivation, and anthropomorphism all have a direct effect on a person's willingness to use AI devices.","The AIDUA framework has several advantages for understanding customers’ attitudes toward using AI in services. First, this framework adapts to intelligent technology by incorporating relevant factors such as anthropomorphism and performance expectancy. Second, the AIDUA framework acknowledges customers' psychological effort (effort expectancy) in using robotic services. Furthermore, this framework captures customers’ ambivalence of using AI in service delivery. That is, in the service context, customers tend to use AI robots due to higher performance expectations (willingness to use AI robots) and may refuse to use AI due to a perceived lack of social interaction (objection to use AI robots). In addition, the three-stage process of developing behavioral intention may reveal more complex insights into the influence of the customers’ culture on their robot-use intention.

In the US, people are more individualistic and have a lower uncertainty avoidance. This means that they are more likely to be comfortable with new technologies and are less likely to be afraid of them. They are also more likely to be interested in using AI robots for personal use.

In China, people are more collectivist and have a higher uncertainty avoidance. This means that they are more likely to be uncomfortable with new technologies and are more likely to be afraid of them. They are also more likely to be interested in using AI robots for public use.

When designing AI robots for different cultures, it is important to take into account the cultural differences between the two countries. For example, in the US, it would be more appropriate to design AI robots that are more individualistic and have a lower uncertainty avoidance. In China, it would be more appropriate to design AI robots that are more collectivist and have a higher uncertainty avoidance.","This study makes several theoretical contributions. First, this study resonates with previous IS studies (e.g., Hong & Cha, 2013; Sarkar et al., 2020; Sullivan & Kim, 2018; Van Pinxteren et al., 2019) by highlighting the direct impact of trust on behavioral intention in the context of AI robot acceptance. This study demonstrates that trust is an indispensable factor that explains customers' behavioral intention controlling for other antecedents of acceptance (e.g., emotion). The original AIDUA framework (Gursoy et al., 2019) suggests that users’ intention is driven by their emotions toward the AI devices. Based on the Tripartite Model of Attitude (Spooncer, 1992), this study finds that users’ evaluations of AI devices not only result in emotional responses but also cognitive beliefs, and these two together influence customers’ intention to use AI robots. By incorporating trust in interaction with hospitality robots, the extended AIDUA framework (Fig. 2) provides a more complete explanation of how customers’ intentions of using AI service robots are developed in service delivery, thus, advancing the literature on human-robot interaction.",27.09%,78.34%,81.86%,47.27%,85.11%

In contrast, in a high-power distance culture (e.g., China), a significantly negative effect of effort expectancy is found. Furthermore, the effect size of effort expectancy is greater than performance expectancy and hedonic motivation.

Then, these lexical features are combined using five general rules that reflect grammatical and syntactical conventions for expressing and emphasizing sentiment intensity. Individual scores for negative, neutral, and positive intensities are then combined into a compound score that captures the overall sentiment of a post. Some example sentiment value calculations by Vader for sample posts are shown in Table 8. These are examples from five different stories, though it is not possible to generalize from them.",22.92%,71.99%,80.59%,28.67%,83.23%
82,h129.png," The table shows the sentiment analysis results of the VADER algorithm on the given dataset. The algorithm is able to identify the sentiment of each text correctly, and the compound sentiment is also calculated correctly.","We included Vader in a Python script to generate the sentiments for all the tweets for the stories in the HNR database. Then we grouped the sentiments by considering the subset of high-interest stories with more than 50 tweets and 100 total posts as explained above. Within each rating group (except rating 0 where only one result was found), we calculated the average sentiments and presented them in Table 9. The average values are split up by tweets, retweets and replies. T-, T0, T + and T-com give the values for the negative, neutral, positive and compound sentiment values, respectively. The counts for different types of posts are also given. We observe that among tweets and retweets, the highest T-com score appears for rating 2 stories, while for replies, it occurs for rating 3 stories, with rating 2 stories just slightly behind. The sentiment scores for rating 4 and 5 stories are much lower in all three categories than for stories with lower ratings.",36.51%,79.08%,84.44%,1.65%,85.91%

The highest sentiment score is 0.83, which is in the row 5 and column 4. This means that the tweets with a rating of 5 have the highest positive sentiment. The lowest sentiment score is -0.16, which is in the row 3 and column 2. This means that the retweets with a rating of 3 have the lowest negative sentiment.","To rule out any possible confounding effect on the ratings from the actual topics of the news stories, we conducted Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling (Blei, Ng, & Jordan, 2003) on the titles of stories rated in three subgroups: 0 & 1; 2 & 3; and 4 & 5. Table 10 reports the main topic keywords uncovered in the posts of the three different rating groups (24 for 0–1 ratings; 20 for 2–3 ratings; and 19 for 4–5 ratings). Ten keywords out of a total of 36 are common among all three rating groups, and 8 keywords belong to two out of the three subgroups. By random chance, the probability that two subsets of 20 words selected randomly from a group of 38 words will have 10 words in common is . To further corroborate this finding, we calculated the similarity between pairs of these three topic groups using SciPy package as (1-cosine distance between topic keyword vectors). In all three pair-wise comparisons, the similarity was 0.46 or higher, suggesting that the topics are not identical but generally similar across rating groups. Of course, the LDA analyses cannot identify any possible confounding effect that influences both the dependent variable and independent variable.",46.24%,88.20%,78.52%,18.41%,87.55%

As Table 11 shows, when comparing topic keywords across a pair of media types, we find that they are closely related, indicating that the stories published by different types of media outlets are generally similar in terms of ratings, indicating their quality. Hence, the topics that are covered across media types are similar and should not affect their ratings.",12.40%,83.00%,79.59%,23.04%,72.75%

The most frequent keyword is ""study"", which appears in all five news media types. Other common keywords include ""cancer"", ""drug"", ""treatment"", and ""health"".

The table shows that there is a lot of overlap in the keywords used by different news media types. This is likely because these keywords are related to important and newsworthy topics. For example, the keyword ""study"" is likely to be used in stories about new research findings, which are often considered to be newsworthy. The keyword ""cancer"" is likely to be used in stories about new cancer treatments or developments, which are also considered to be newsworthy.","Through the years, AT has been extended through three generations, each generation of AT holds value under certain contexts (Hasan and Kazlauskas, 2014, Hashim and Jones, 2007, Zurita and Nussbaum, 2007). The three generations of AT are summarized in Fig. 1.",13.63%,64.77%,80.76%,37.60%,73.87%
86,h133.jpg," The first-generation activity theory (Engeström, 1987) is a model of human activity that focuses on the relationship between the individual and the social context. The model consists of three main components: the subject, the object, and the community. The subject is the individual who is engaged in the activity. The object is the goal or purpose of the activity. The community is the social context in which the activity takes place.

The second-generation activity theory (Engeström, 1999) is a more complex model of human activity that takes into account the role of artifacts and rules in mediating the relationship between the individual and the social context. The model consists of four main components: the subject, the object, the community, and the instrument. The instrument is a tool or artifact that is used to mediate the activity. The rules are the social norms and expectations that govern the activity.

The first- and second-generation activity theories are both useful for understanding human activity. The first-generation activity theory provides a basic framework for understanding the relationship between the individual and the social context. The second-generation activity theory provides a more complex model that takes into account the role of artifacts and rules in mediating the relationship between the individual and the social context.

The main difference between first and second-generation activity theory is that the second-generation theory takes into account the role of artifacts and rules in mediating the relationship between the individual and the social context. This is a significant difference because it allows for a more nuanced understanding of human activity. For example, the second-generation activity theory can be used to understand how artifacts and rules can be used to support or constrain human activity.","To sum up, the theoretical framework is in line with the concept of expansive transformation (Valecha et al., 2012) and is based on the third generation of AT. We name the framework as Dual Interacting Activity Systems (DIAS). Specifically, such framework consists of two key considerations: (1) generating or spreading misinformation, and (2) mitigating or minimizing the harm of misinformation.

These objectives are to spread misinformation and to correct misinformation. The diagram also lists the strategies and tactics that each group uses to achieve their objectives. The misinformation generators use strategies such as creating fake news, using social media to spread misinformation, and targeting vulnerable communities.

Numerous misinformation was generated, and later was detected and corrected (Lee et al., 2015). The specific use- case that we discuss focuses on the intergroup prejudice detection system as reported in Dutta et al. (2018). Their ultimate goal was to identify prejudiced messages automatically by examining specific lists of words like “swear words, subjective words and sentiment lexicons” (Cardoso Durier da Silva et al., 2019).

Scenario	Descriptions
Scenario 1:	Various rumors spread quickly on social media after a bombing erupted near the finish line of Boston Marathon event on April 15th, 2013. It was reported that many services were shut down, including cell phone services and flights. Later, official news corrected the misinformation with the rebuttal that cell phone services did not shut down, and the flights were grounded because of computer problems but not the bombing crisis.
Scenario 2:	A rumor during hurricane Harvey claimed that shelters would check immigration status. Undocumented immigrants were said to be reported to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). That information was then officially announced to be false by both ICE and CBP as well as the organizations running the shelters.
Scenario 3:	An evacuation order was sent to the nearby community due to rapidly eroding area because of flooding. However, National Weather Service (NWS) Sacramento wrongly released mapped pictures of widespread flooding covering all of Sacramento County and the Oroville Dam, which misled people to believe that the entire Sacramento County needed to be evacuated. Although the information was corrected on Twitter half an hour later, evacuation calls had already spread. The staff of Sacramento County EOC had to make a Facebook Live Video in order to officially reject the misinformation.
Scenario 4:	Although it is common in California to see wildfires annually, the 2018 wildfires got caught on social media channels. Numerous pictures were posted. It later turned out that several images were old pictures from other fires in 2000, 2007 and 2017. The misinformation created unnecessary fears, worries and other consequences for California citizens.","The four aforementioned crisis situations were chosen based on the following criteria. First, these have been reported by other studies for which response and recovery efforts were plagued by misinformation (Bell, 2018, Holdeman, 2018, Nealon, 2017).

Summary of validation exercise – Scenario 2: Hurricane Harvey 2017.,"The UTAUT model contains four independent constructs that directly influence behavioral intention (BI) and use behavior (USE): performance expectancy (PE), effort expectancy (EE), facilitating conditions (FC), and social influence (SI). These constructs are considered the main drivers of technology diffusion (Venkatesh et al., 2003) and explain a significant proportion of the variance in adoption and use behavior (Dwivedi et al., 2017). This study excluded behavioral intention (BI) as it focused on the actual users of the social media, who had experience in dealing with its applications. Even though UTAUT has high predictive power and can provide a comprehensive picture of the main aspects shaping technology adoption, there are other factors that should be considered with the UTAUT core factors as a necessity required by the nature of the tested technology (i.e., social media) and the targeted sector (i.e., NPOs). This fact has been reported by Venkatesh et al. (2003, 2012), who highly recommended validating the model over other sectors and considering other factors.

1. **Initial Ideas:** The research process begins with the researcher having some initial ideas about the topic they want to research. 

2. **Search and Acquisition:** The researcher then starts to search for and acquire information related to their topic. This can be done through a variety of sources, such as books, journals, articles, and the internet.

3. **Selecting:** Once the researcher has acquired a significant amount of information, they need to select the most relevant and useful information for their research. 

4. **Sorting:** The researcher then needs to sort the information they have selected into different categories or groups. This will help them to organize their information and make it easier to analyze.

5. **Refining:** The researcher may need to refine their search terms or criteria to find more relevant information.

6. **Reading:** The researcher then needs to read and analyze the information they have selected. This will help them to gain a deeper understanding of the topic and to identify any gaps in their knowledge.

7. **Identifying:** The researcher then needs to identify the key themes, concepts, and arguments in the information they have read. 

8. **Mapping and Classifying:** The researcher then needs to map out the relationships between the different themes, concepts, and arguments they have identified. This will help them to see the bigger picture and to identify any patterns or trends in the information.

9. **Critical Assessment:** The researcher then needs to critically assess the information they have gathered. This means evaluating the credibility, reliability, and validity of the information.

10. **Literature Review:** The researcher then needs to write a literature review, which is a summary of the research that has been done on the topic. This will help them to position their own research in the context of the existing literature.

11. **Argument Development:** The researcher then needs to develop an argument or thesis statement that they will explore in their research. This will help them to focus their research and to stay on track.

12. **Analysis and Interpretation:** The researcher then needs to analyze and interpret the information they have gathered. This means drawing conclusions from the information and developing new insights into the topic.

13. **Presentation:** The researcher then needs to present their findings in a clear and concise manner.

Morrow et al. (2009) propose that ethical guidelines for CE can be derived from the literature on ethics, specifically research involving both human and animal subjects, as these can be applied directly to CE research. This reflects CE research being relatively new and lacking clear guidelines per se. Hubert and Reichwein (2015) reiterate this by saying that although the scientific community has general guidelines regarding research, such large-scale research in the open environment does not have any set guidelines. Further, Reynolds (2011) questions how binding such guidelines would be, stating that there are already global initiatives to develop such guidelines for CE research. Morrow (2017) argues that guidelines for CE should be clear and qualitative and that as the scope of the impacts of CE research increases, so too will the proportion of the strictness of those guidelines.

Codes are voluntary sets of principles that outline responsible behavior in a particular area. Frameworks are more comprehensive than codes and typically include specific goals and objectives. Guidelines are more detailed than frameworks and provide specific instructions on how to implement a particular policy or regulation.

The graphic also shows the different types of climate engineering governance that exist within each category. For example, the Oxford Principles and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) are both codes of conduct for responsible climate engineering research. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Paris Agreement are both frameworks for international cooperation on climate change mitigation and adaptation. The Precautionary Principle and the Earth System Governance (ESG) Research Framework are both guidelines for developing and implementing climate engineering policies.

Instrumental needs motivate users to seek informational content, make calls for appointments and meetings, and order products and services, whereas non-instrumental needs (e.g., hedonism) drive users to seek diversionary content or content that serves curiosity, personal advice-seeking, need for adventure, and community (Joo & Sang, 2013). In the information systems (IS) literature, the utilitarian value of IS has been shown to influence individual acceptance because the system helps to achieve certain user goals (Matook & van der Heijden, 2013).

107,h154.png," The Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model is a model that attempts to explain the factors that affect whether or not a person will use a particular technology. The model was developed by Venkatesh, Morris, Davis, and Davis in 2003.

The UTAUT model is based on the idea that a person's intention to use a technology is influenced by four factors: performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, and facilitating conditions. Performance expectancy is the degree to which a person believes that using the technology will help them achieve their goals. Effort expectancy is the degree to which a person believes that using the technology will be easy. Social influence is the degree to which a person believes that others think they should use the technology. Facilitating conditions are the factors that make it easier or harder for a person to use the technology.

The UTAUT model has been used to explain the adoption of a wide variety of technologies, including e-commerce, mobile phones, and social media. The model has been found to be a good predictor of technology adoption, and it has been used to develop strategies to increase the adoption of new technologies.","Fig. 2 shows this mapping—political factors are represented as infrastructure; technological factors as technical and support services; legal factors as the legal and regulatory framework; economic factors as financial matters and affordability; and social factors as self-efficacy. In the following section, we discuss these contextual factors.",15.53%,90.04%,81.10%,36.70%,78.91%
108,h155.png, Comparison of facilitating conditions in prior literature and our study. The conditions in bold are the ones that were not identified in prior literature.,"Fig. 1 shows that ‘manifestation of resistance’ is the main adoption antecedent triggered by high power distance, subsequently associated with low user adoption. An example of such episodes was found in case MS4 (see Appendix 1): “the communication was: this is what is happening!”, which in turn led to the manifestation of resistance where users admitted that “people found it hard to commit”. This episode illustrates how an Enterprise System became an agent and enforcer of stricter and more instrumental policies at non-academic departments in a university institution at the expense of academic departments. This had a negative effect on user adoption. However, in contrast, the second most frequent antecedent affected by high power distance (Social Influence) increased user adoption. The high power distance underpinned a strong social influence over the users, which generally increased their adoption. For instance, in cultures with a high power distance, a classic champion for the project is not necessary, as illustrated in the following quote: “We suggest that in the Chinese context, the concept of a champion, as distinct from top management, is not important because the top manager is perceived to be champion.”. The social influence of top management had a clear impact in this case: “What top management insists on will happen.” and “Change is accepted if it is demanded” (RL11). This led to high user adoption. Two other antecedents were frequently affected by a high power distance, namely ‘performance expectancy’ (10%) and ‘facilitating conditions’ (11.7%), which both caused low user adoption. Facilitating conditions are the organizational and technical infrastructures that support the use of the system.",30.78%,83.77%,80.40%,0.00%,83.61%
109,h156.png," The diagram shows the results of a study on the factors that influence user adoption of new technology. The study found that there are five main factors that influence user adoption: performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions, and perceived threat.

The most important factor is performance expectancy, which is the user's belief that the new technology will be able to improve their performance. This is followed by effort expectancy, which is the user's belief that the new technology will be easy to use. Social influence is also an important factor, as users are more likely to adopt new technology if they see others using it. Facilitating conditions are also important, as users are more likely to adopt new technology if they have the resources and support they need to do so. Finally, perceived threat is a barrier to adoption, as users are less likely to adopt new technology if they believe it will be harmful or disruptive.

The study also found that the relationship between these factors and user adoption is moderated by power distance, which is the extent to which individuals in a society accept and expect that power is distributed unequally. In societies with high power distance, users are more likely to adopt new technology if it is endorsed by authority figures. In societies with low power distance, users are more likely to adopt new technology if they believe it will benefit them personally.

The study's findings suggest that organizations can increase the likelihood of user adoption of new technology by focusing on the five main factors that influence adoption. Organizations should also consider the role of power distance in their adoption strategies. In societies with high power distance, organizations should focus on getting buy-in from authority figures. In societies with low power distance, organizations should focus on demonstrating the personal benefits of the new technology.","Of the 30 observations of an individualist culture, 26 were negatively associated with user adoption (Fig. 2). Manifestations of resistance are reflected in the following quotes: “This shed light on the existence of a continuing struggle to impose one organization identity as being dominant over and against the other competing alternative.”. This led to “us-versus-them” scenarios and even talked about “war between the two adult sites” (RL52). Another antecedent that was regularly found to cause decreased user adoption was low ‘facilitating conditions’ (8 observations, Fig. 2). This was due to the ‘individualist’ nature of the training provided during the implementation. An episode from case RL12 shows this individualist nature: “team members developed their skills based on self-study and self-training during the project.” which led to “project team members complaining about their training,” which was associated with low user adoption of the system.",36.47%,80.95%,81.88%,44.09%,82.53%
110,h157.png," The diagram shows the relationship between individualism and user adoption. Individualism is a cultural value that emphasizes the importance of individual autonomy and self-reliance. It is often contrasted with collectivism, which emphasizes the importance of group harmony and cooperation.

The diagram shows that individualism is positively correlated with user adoption. This means that people who are more individualistic are more likely to adopt new technologies. There are several possible explanations for this. First, individualists are more likely to be open to new experiences and ideas. They are also more likely to be risk-tolerant and to have a high need for achievement. These personality traits make individualists more likely to try new technologies and to persist with them even if they encounter difficulties.

Second, individualists are more likely to have the resources necessary to adopt new technologies. They are more likely to have access to financial resources and to have the skills and knowledge necessary to use new technologies. This makes it easier for individualists to adopt new technologies.

Third, individualists are more likely to live in cultures that support the adoption of new technologies. These cultures are more likely to have a high level of technological development and to have a positive attitude towards new technologies. This makes it easier for individualists to find the support they need to adopt new technologies.

The diagram also shows that the relationship between individualism and user adoption is moderated by several factors. These factors include performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions, and perceived threat.

Performance expectancy is the belief that a new technology will perform as expected. Effort expectancy is the belief that a new technology will be easy to use. Social influence is the pressure from others to adopt a new technology. Facilitating conditions are the resources and support that are available to help people adopt a new technology. Perceived threat is the belief that a new technology will have negative consequences.

The diagram shows that the relationship between individualism and user adoption is strongest when performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions, and perceived threat are all high. This suggests that the most successful technology adoptions are those that are seen as being useful, easy to use, and supported by others.

The diagram also shows that the relationship between individualism and user adoption is weakest when performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions, and perceived threat are all low. This suggests that the least successful technology adoptions are those that are seen as being useless, difficult to use, and not supported by others.

The diagram provides a useful framework for understanding the relationship between individualism and user adoption. It can be used to help identify the factors that are most likely to influence the adoption of a new technology. This information can be used to develop more effective marketing and adoption strategies.","Expectation 1, regarding power distance, is partially confirmed, as our findings not only include cases where a high power distance results in support for ES implementation but also include other examples where this mobilizes resistance. This apparent contradiction illustrates that culture is a multi-faceted phenomenon where the inherently interrelated cultural dimensions can mobilize both acceptance and resistance. The two culture profiles (Fig. 7) indicate that a culture that combines a high power distance with a long-term orientation and collectivism tends to accept an ES, while high power distance combined with individualism and short-term orientation, is more likely to result in resistance.",25.37%,88.79%,81.72%,38.25%,79.92%

For the derivation of the design principles, we followed the approach outlined by Lechler, Stoeckli, Rietsche, & Uebernickel (2019). The first design principle, Targeted Communication (DP1), highlights the importance of providing the CA with a minimum of social cues. This may allow affected people to focus on reliable information. This DP contradicts the findings of Feine et al. (2019) who emphasize the importance of CA’s social cues for several CAs In the context of disasters, excluding social cues of a CA might lead to a lower application of stereotypes, e.g., gender stereotypes (Nass, Moon, & Green, 1997). Following, people focus on the information itself and are less biased by entrenched stereotypes. This may allow those affected by the crisis to save cognitive resources and directly convert helpful information into action. This may help EMAs to receive valuable information in order to obtain their supply chains during crisis events (Shareef et al., 2020). CAs can thus also provide important information as a basis for decision making, which according to Dwivedi et al. (2020) is one of the great potentials of AI-based systems. However, this could differ between types and phases of crises as these differ in terms of crisis communication strategies (Gupta et al., 2016). Furthermore, the CA needs to consider the EMA’s function during the crisis as those might be responsible for specified activities such as forecasting, the distribution of supplies, or the coordination with other (non) government organizations (Gupta et al., 2016).",0.00%,56.86%,78.86%,0.00%,77.29%

Powered by IT such as AI, blockchain, and 5G (French, Shim, Risius, Larsen, & Jain, 2021), the fourth industrial revolution seeks to develop modular and efficient manufacturing systems that allow individualization of products or even “batch-size-one” production. As industry’s greenhouse gas emissions increasingly draw scrutiny, the shift away from climate denialism means climate actions must be kept close to the core of the fourth industrial revolution. In Singapore, for example, an advanced energy dashboard based on IOT has been developed for monitoring and controlling energy consumption in manufacturing processes (Engie Lab, 2018). For information research, the obvious opportunities include leveraging big data for energy optimization and designing machine learning applications to infuse renewable energy, recycled resources, and recyclable materials into cyber-physical systems (see section 2.1). Beyond these, information researchers specialising in open innovation or inter-organisational systems can promote Climate 4.0 by providing guidance for eco-innovation in supply chain (see Table 2). The benefits of Climate 4.0 can only be maximized if there is technology transfer to developing countries (Kirchherr & Urban, 2018).

The circle continues, and biases are reinforced (Fig. 5). ",36.10%,88.36%,82.13%,44.28%,84.43%
120,h167.png," The diagram shows the cycle of how gender bias can affect the funding and implementation of programs to address sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV). The cycle starts with donors not seeing evidence of SGBV, which leads to biased funding decisions. This results in biased funding proposals, which are then approved by headquarters. The biased funding proposals lead to a lack of funding for SGBV interventions, which in turn leads to a lack of services for survivors of SGBV. This lack of services leads to under-reporting of SGBV, which perpetuates the cycle.","Three statistical methods are frequently used to explore the core knowledge including factor analysis, multi-dimensional scaling analysis, and cluster analysis. Factor analysis is a statistical technique that is used to reduce a large number of variables into fewer numbers of factors. Cluster analysis is used for classification. Multi-dimensional scaling analysis simplifies multi-space samples into low-dimensional spaces and is used to visualize the data through a two-dimension diagram (Hsiao & Yang, 2011; Shiau & Dwivedi, 2012; Shiau et al., 2017).

123,h170.png," The diagram shows the relationships between different factors that can affect the outcome of a project. The factors are grouped into three categories: positive drivers, negative drivers, and enablers.

The positive drivers are factors that can help to improve the outcome of a project. These include things like having a clear goal, a strong team, and a well-defined plan.

The negative drivers are factors that can hinder the outcome of a project. These include things like having a lack of resources, a weak team, or a poorly defined plan.

The enablers are factors that can help to mitigate the effects of the negative drivers. These include things like having a strong support network, a clear communication plan, and a risk management plan.

The diagram shows that the positive drivers and the enablers can have a positive impact on the outcome of a project, while the negative drivers can have a negative impact. The enablers can also help to mitigate the effects of the negative drivers.

The diagram can be used to help project managers identify the factors that are most likely to affect the outcome of their project. This information can then be used to develop strategies to improve the chances of success.","It is interesting to observe from Table 3 that there are seven −ve paths and three +ve paths in this case example. The sole +ve driver criterion is ‘Awareness’ which gives a positive influence on the outcome criteria via cost, time frame, and acceptability variables. The +ve driver needs to be strengthened and −ve drivers need to be controlled to improve the success of the information linked change programme. This kind of analysis needs to be reflected in the evaluation of any information and organizational change programme and development of the theory of its evaluation.",42.06%,89.62%,83.43%,44.50%,83.64%
124,h171.png," The table shows the path through the variables and the polarity of the path. The path is from the driver variables to the dependent variable, which is acceptability. The polarity of the path indicates whether the relationship between the variables is positive or negative. A positive polarity indicates that a positive change in the driver variable will lead to a positive change in the dependent variable. A negative polarity indicates that a positive change in the driver variable will lead to a negative change in the dependent variable.

For example, the path from the driver variable ""difficulty and complexity"" to the dependent variable ""acceptability"" has a negative polarity. This means that a positive change in difficulty and complexity will lead to a negative change in acceptability. In other words, as the difficulty and complexity of a task increases, the acceptability of the task decreases.","The methodology used for the review of literature is presented in this section.

This was done by searching through various databases and websites, as well as by snowballing. The initial pool of articles and books was then screened for inclusion and exclusion criteria. The inclusion criteria were that the article or book had to be relevant to the study and had to be published in a peer-reviewed journal or book. The exclusion criteria were that the article or book was not relevant to the study, was not published in a peer-reviewed journal or book, or was not available in full text.

The articles and books that met the inclusion criteria were then classified and categorized. The classification was based on the type of article or book, such as research article, review article, or book chapter. The categorization was based on the topic of the article or book, such as technology adoption, technology continuance, or learning outcomes.

The next step was to map the articles and books to the research questions. This was done by identifying the key themes and concepts that were discussed in the articles and books. The key themes and concepts were then mapped to the research questions.

Compared to sharing simple knowledge, more cognitive effort is needed to codify a greater amount of knowledge (i.e., focal as well as interdependent knowledge), explain their interrelationships, and collate knowledge from different employees to adequately capture the complexity. In the words of Davenport and Prusak (1998), complex knowledge is difficult to share owing to its high viscosity (thickness of knowledge) and limited velocity (speed of flow). This study hypothesizes that the perceived effort required to codify complex knowledge is alleviated when the affordance of association is strong. Association makes one’s social connections explicit and facilitates reach to other related users (Treem & Leonardi, 2013). Our hypothesis emerges from the recognition that complex knowledge is interdependent and association allows one to involve others who have knowledge of the subcomponents in the sharing and thereby distribute the effort of codification among related knowledge providers. In support, Majchrzak, Wagner, and Yates (2013) argued that a more conversational model of knowledge sharing that relies on many knowledge providers, each making small, partial contributions, can overcome the challenges related to limited supply of experts and limited time available to share knowledge. Association also facilitates access to related content (Treem & Leonardi, 2013) that can be reused for the sharing, further reducing the codification effort.

130,h177.png," The diagram shows the relationship between organization, technology, and environment on the performance of a company.

The organization is the foundation of any business. It includes the people, processes, and culture that make up the company. The technology is the tools and resources that the company uses to operate. The environment is the external factors that affect the company, such as the economy, competition, and regulations.

All three of these factors are important for a company's performance. The organization must be well-structured and efficient in order to be successful. The technology must be up-to-date and effective in order to keep the company competitive. The environment must be favorable in order for the company to grow and prosper.

The diagram also shows that the relationship between these three factors is complex. The organization, technology, and environment are all interconnected and interdependent. A change in one factor can have a ripple effect on the other two factors.

For example, a change in the organization, such as a merger or acquisition, can have a significant impact on the technology and environment. Similarly, a change in the technology, such as the introduction of a new product or service, can have a significant impact on the organization and environment.

The key to success is to find the right balance between these three factors. The organization, technology, and environment must all be aligned in order for the company to achieve its goals.","Table 1 summarizes the descriptive statistics of the predictors and dependent variable. The sample size N, is less than 760 due to missing data, another limitation discussed in Section 5. The percent of firms whose recent loan application was rejected, proportion of investments financed by banks, and the percent of firms with an internationally recognized quality certification are substantially positively skewed (skewness = 1.80, skewness = 1.23, and skewness = 1.57 respectively).

There are several missing data for the percent of firms whose recent loan application was rejected, resulting in 254 records for this variable. There are also other missing values in the data set, but we refrained from imputation for three reasons. First, each record is independent because an industry record in a specific country and specific year, has no bearing on other industry records, be it in the same country and/or year, thus making imputation more difficult. Second, even though imputation is possible with independent records, the process introduces some degree of error. To avoid this, we preserve the dataset and use a decision tree induction method capable of handling missing data. Third, there are many imputation methods, such as mean, regression, and maximum likelihood, but the choice of method depends on factors such as randomness and possible reasons for the missing data. Researchers may not be privy to these factors (Lodder, 2013), which applies in our case, since we are using secondary data.

To formulate our arguments, we build on studies that suggest both technologies and market or user needs contribute to organizational innovation. We theorize how platform technologies and collaborative business needs affect collaborative innovation capabilities. Further, to complete our model, we evaluate the direct effects of collaborative innovation capabilities on the lower-level operational capabilities, such as digital collaboration capabilities. Indeed, in prior studies, dynamic capabilities and operational capabilities have been discussed thoroughly. However, the relationship of higher-level and lower-level operational capabilities has been under-addressed (Mishra et al., 2013; Nam, 2018). In summary, we propose the fit effects of platform technologies and collaborative business needs on collaborative innovation capabilities and then collaborative innovation capabilities enable the generation of digital collaboration capabilities",16.33%,60.44%,78.28%,26.32%,83.77%

Although we theoretically propose that collaborative innovation capabilities affects digital collaboration capabilities based on the operational capability hierarchies view, the concern exists that collaborative innovation capabilities may be improved by digital collaboration capabilities. It indicates that endogeneity bias is a potential problem for this research. We conducted a two-step Heckman analysis (Bharadwaj, Bharadwaj, & Bendoly, 2007) to evaluate reverse causation that digital collaboration capabilities may help improve collaborative innovation capabilities.

The Heckman analysis results show that digital collaboration capability has a significant positive effect on the level of digital collaboration capability. The inverse Mills ratio is also significant and negative, which indicates that the Heckman correction for sample selection bias is necessary. The antecedent of DCC is not significant.","To understand the antecedents, consequences, and boundary conditions of knowledge integration in the Wiki context, we propose a research model as shown in Fig. 1.

Perceived equivocality is proposed to moderate the relationship between perceived justice / perceived value and knowledge integration and the relationship between knowledge integration and knowledge quality. Further, following the prior studies (e.g., Fadel & Durcikova, 2014), demographic variables (such as gender, age, education, experience) and perceived expertise are included as control variables. Perceived expertise is taken into account because the prior studies have suggested that self-efficacy may have important impacts on knowledge contribution (Hsu et al., 2007) and knowledge quality (Chiu et al., 2006).",23.73%,91.63%,81.56%,39.30%,79.89%

In addition, discriminant validity can be examined by checking whether the square root of the AVE of the given construct is greater than the correlations between the construct and any other construct (Fornell & Larcker, 1981).",20.32%,89.57%,81.55%,25.75%,77.25%
140,h187.png, All of the constructs demonstrated adequate convergent validity as indicated by the AVE values being greater than 0.50. Discriminant validity was supported as the square root of the AVE for each construct was greater than the correlations between the constructs. Internal consistency reliability was supported as all of the constructs demonstrated Cronbach's alpha values greater than 0.70.,"As depicted in Fig. 1, Payne et al. (2008) suggest that engagement in collaboration and relationship experiences consists of cognitive, emotional, and behavioral engagement. Cognitive engagement, which describes engagement in goal-directed activities, relates to the utilitarian side of decision making, such as needing a product or service that could ease users’ daily activities. Emotional engagement relates to non-utilitarian aspects of consumption and of valuing the experience of the process, such as from playing a game. Behavioral engagement occurs as a result of perceived cognitive and emotional experience, such as by exhibiting co-innovation actions. The crowdsourcer processes related to user innovation center on leading the innovation activities and designing the relationship experience, which involve providing technology for customers’ contributions and inviting customers to participate in the activity. Attracting customers to participate requires an understanding of their motivations; the crowdsourcer also needs to be able to provide support for the participants. An important crowdsourcer process is the development of relevant metrics to measure the outcomes of crowdsourcing activity",27.38%,88.27%,79.92%,7.52%,78.36%
141,h188.png," The figure shows theプロセス of customer engagement in co-innovation and relationship experience. 

Theプロセス starts with the customer learning about the company and its products or services. This can be done through a variety of channels, such as the company's website, social media, or through word-of-mouth. 

Once the customer has learned about the company, they may become engaged in collaboration and relationship experience. This can be done through a variety of activities, such as providing feedback on products or services, participating in surveys or contests, or joining a loyalty program. 

As the customer becomes more engaged, they may develop opportunities for user innovation. This can be done by suggesting new products or services, or by providing feedback on existing products or services. 

The company can then use this feedback to plan user innovation and implement and assess outcomes. This can lead to improved products or services, which can in turn lead to increased customer satisfaction and loyalty. 

The entireプロセス is supported by organizational learning. This means that the company is constantly learning from its customers and using that feedback to improve its products, services, and processes.","The purpose of this study was to investigate how user innovation can be used as an engagement mechanism for crowdsourcing-based marketing initiatives. To this end, we have presented a case study of a hamburger design contest. We adapted Payne et al.’s (2008) co-creation framework to build our analytical framework, which we used to structure our analysis. Our study emphasizes the importance of activities and technical features that enable socializing with other participants, support active participation, and create a participatory experience. Second, our results provide insights into how social media can be used to engage users in marketing-focused crowdsourcing activities. Fig. 3 presents the framework construction based on our findings. The main findings of the study relate to the three encounter D. Pacauskas et al. International Journal of Information Management 43 (2018) 319–327 325 processes we have identified: fostering social interaction, facilitating identity construction, and creating a game-like user experience. Fostering social interaction describes capabilities to integrate users in their preferred social environment, such as using the system in a group or by themselves. Facilitating identity construction refers to the platform’s ability to provide customers with a means to link the activities in the platform and to communicate virtual and real-life identities. Finally, creating game-like experience refers to the characteristics of the platform that draw and sustain participants’ attention; our observations underscore the role of a game-like experience in fostering customer participation. This finding aligns with prior crowdsourcing research (Birke et al., 2013) and supports the use of gamification (Deterding, Sicart, Nacke, OöHara, & Dixon, 2011; Hamari & Koivisto, 2015) in designing crowdsourcing initiatives and platforms.",38.64%,91.60%,81.11%,35.66%,85.85%
142,h189.png," The figure shows the relationships between the three constructs of customer engagement, crowdsourcing processes, and user innovation. The arrows between the constructs show the direction of the relationships. The relationships are based on the following:

Customer engagement is related to crowdsourcing processes in that customers can be engaged in the process of crowdsourcing. For example, customers can be involved in the ideation, development, and testing of new products or services.

Crowdsourcing processes are related to user innovation in that they can be used to generate new ideas and solutions from a large pool of people. For example, companies can use crowdsourcing to find new ways to improve their products or services.

User innovation is related to customer engagement in that it can be used to create new products or services that meet the needs of customers. For example, companies can use user innovation to develop new products or services that are more engaging and relevant to their customers.","""Survey results - usage and demand among Swedish extension offices
The respondents were asked what type of weather or climate information they currently use in their profession, and the results show that weather forecasts are the most common type of information used among the respondents (Fig. 2), whereas climate change projections are the least used. On the four-point Likert scale ranging from ‘Never’ to ‘Very often’ using the information, 26 (40.0 % of the respondents to that question) replied that they never use climate change projections. While only six respondents use climate change projections ‘very often’, 52.5 % (n = 21) of the respondents that replied that they have used projections at some point (n = 40,) regarded the information as very important to their profession (see, Supplementary Material). Conversely, two respondents that use climate projections responded that they do not regard the information as important in their profession.""",33.57%,74.58%,80.51%,49.37%,79.62%

Participants were recruited via an invitation emailed to all undergraduates enrolled in computer engineering (CE), electrical engineering (EE), and mechanical engineering (ME) programs through each department's LISTSERV. Of the 1315 undergraduates subscribed to the three LISTSERVs, 103 undergraduates participated in the questionnaire, which is an overall response rate of 7.8%.

Specifically, we carried out an agglomerative hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA). HCA classifies observations into groups of similar observations that are also dissimilar from other clusters (Yim & Ramdeen, 2015), allowing us to identify groups of genres and tasks.

There are two approaches to HCA: agglomerative and divisive. We were primarily concerned with the similarity between neighboring clusters, so we performed an agglomerative HCA. In this method, each observation begins in a cluster of its own, that is, a singleton. Then the two most similar clusters are merged into a new cluster. This process continues until one cluster contains all observations (Everitt et al., 2011).

HCA uses the distance between groups as a measurement of similarity: the closer two clusters are, the more similar they are. In HCA, clusters are grouped together based on a distance metric (e.g., Euclidean, Mahalanobis, or Manhattan distance) and a linking technique (e.g., single, complete, or average linkage). We used the Euclidean distance metric, which is among the most commonly used metrics (Everitt et al., 2011). For a linking metric, which measures the distance between clusters, we used the average linkage. This calculates the mean distance between all members of the two clusters and, consequently, accounts for the structure of the clusters (Husson et al., 2017). Average linkage is more robust than the single and complete linkage, which are more sensitive to outliers (Everitt et al., 2011).

The visual output of a cluster analysis is a dendrogram—a tree diagram that displays the hierarchical relationships between the observations at each step of the analysis. We created two dendrograms: one for genres and another for tasks (Figure 4). The dendrogram is “cut” to identify clusters. We cut the tree diagrams at the heights suggested by the factoextra package.

Sina Weibo and WeChat dominate the social media landscape in Chinese society, and both of them exert significant influence in Chinese society and play an indispensable role in modern life (Jackie, 2020). Sina Weibo is a microblogging network, a bit like Twitter if we must have a Western comparison. It has around 573 million monthly active users (Koshi et al., 2022). Tencent WeChat is a close community, and the closest Western analog may be WhatsApp. Normally, WeChat users can only see posts pushed by official accounts to which they subscribe (Jackie, 2020). But WeChat users can input keywords in the search bar within WeChat to search and read posts published by other accounts to which they do not subscribe. WeChat has about 1.27 billion monthly active users across all age categories (Koshi et al., 2022). Since the lifting of the Zero-COVID policy, namely the announcement of 10 measures on December 7, 2022 (Global Times, 2022), verified Weibo and WeChat users, who may or may not be science popularizers, have conducted online polls to track the proportion of participants who self-report as ever having a positive COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or rapid antigen test (RAT) result, or as remaining negative, in view of the rapid increase of Omicron infections around them.

Sina Weibo has a verification policy to confirm the identity of a personal user or organization, similar to Twitter's account verification (https://kefu.weibo.com/faqdetail?id=37). On Weibo, verified users can create online polls (https://kefu.weibo.com/faqdetail?id=20533); as on Twitter, the default duration of these polls is one day, and the poll results are instantly displayed. Similarly, verified Tencent WeChat users can register as a public account, which enables them to interact with subscribers, and WeChat online polls can be conducted via such accounts (https://kf.qq.com/faq/161221FN7fi6161221NRBJzq.html). Normally, these poll results of both social media are publicly available and anonymized (Figure 1).

158,h205.jpg," This is a survey conducted by WeChat public account ""The Lab of Three Dads"". The survey is about COVID-19 infection status. 

The survey has been conducted for one week. A total of 5406 people participated in the survey. 

The results show that 61% of the participants' families have been infected with COVID-19. 22% of the participants' families have not been infected. 16% of the participants' families have had one member infected.","To measure the un-infection rate, the collected results of these online polls were coded, followed with a procedure converting the heterogeneous results of online polls with varying options to binary results and exact dates to time intervals. After coding, one type of result was about participants who reported that they had not been infected with COVID-19; another merged the results of various options, which included the participants reporting their symptoms during or after their acute infection phase and the participants reporting they have been infected once or several times. One type of option that allows social media users to see the results of the online poll without disclosing their personal health status, such as “see results,” was not merged and excluded from the final dataset. Based on the above information, the un-infection rate, namely the proportion of participants who have not been infected with COVID-19, can be calculated. For example, the exampled four-option poll was originally to investigate the prevalence of COVID-19 reinfection. When we coded this four-option poll, the un-infection rate was coded only if Option 3 was chosen. The exampled five-option poll was intended to investigate the infectivity of COVID-19 within family members. When we coded this five-option poll, the un-infection rate was coded if Option 1, Option 2, or Option 3 was chosen.

To measure the dissemination of scientific information, those social media conducting online polls were classified into two types of information sources based on their previous posting records: (1) Scientific information group (Group S): this group of information sources had been focusing on disseminating scientific information about COVID-19 since before the lifting of the Zero-COVID strategy, namely the announcement of the “10 measures”; (2) Non-scientific information group (Group N): Before the lifting of Zero-COVID policies, this group almost did not disseminate scientific information about COVID-19 and mainly disseminated information on other topics, such as business news, military situation, and societal issues. After the lifting of Zero-COVID policies, the pandemic became the most crucial public agenda, and the non-scientific information group also started to publish COVID-related content, such as the COVID surge (Doucleff, 2022), symptoms of infection, treatment of COVID-19, the shortage of fever drugs (Pierson et al., 2022), chaos at hospitals (Qian & Pierson, 2022), the battered economy (Laura, 2022; Zhu & Lee, 2022), and the progress of this epidemic wave. The determination of both groups is not the number of scientific posts published during a time period. The fundamental difference between the two groups is the starting time of disseminating scientific information about COVID-19.

**3. Convert flowcharts to directed graphs:** Once the shapes have been detected, the flowcharts can be converted into directed graphs. This will make it easier to compare the flowcharts and detect any similarities.

**4. Similarity check:** The next step is to check for similarities between the flowcharts. This can be done by comparing the structures of the graphs, as well as the shapes of the individual nodes.

The decision tree model is a powerful tool for understanding complex relationships between variables. It can be used to identify patterns in data, to make predictions, and to classify data points. However, it is important to note that the decision tree model is only as good as the data used to train it. If the data is biased or incomplete, the model will also be biased or incomplete.

In addition, the decision tree model can be complex and difficult to interpret. This can make it difficult to understand how the model makes predictions. As a result, it is important to carefully consider the data used to train the model and the complexity of the model before using it to make predictions.","This paper proposes a method and an algorithm to design a queuing network in terms of parallel test stations at city entrance links.

The first module aims to reduce the searching space by identifying the most relevant context for the query. Specifically, we leverage a pre-trained language model (e.g., BERT) to encode both the query and the context documents, and then compute the semantic similarity between them. The top-k most similar context documents are then selected for further processing.

The second module aims to reduce the size of each context document while preserving its important information. To this end, we employ a text summarization technique to extract the most important sentences from each document. Specifically, we use the pre-trained language model to score the importance of each sentence, and then select the top-k most important sentences to form the reduced context.

The third module aims to rank the sentences in the reduced context according to their relevance to the query. We propose a query-based sentence ranking method which leverages the pre-trained language model to compute the relevance score between each sentence and the query. The top-k sentences with the highest relevance scores are then selected as the final answer.","For context-based QA, generally, the answers reside within a couple of sentences. If the smallest amount of context for a certain question can be identified, the same response can be provided by LLMs at a lower cost i.e. less prompt tokens.

The context removal component then removes the remaining context after the last sentence selected by the position-aware text reduction component.,"Fig. 4 shows how LeanContext constructs the Reduced Context. It retains the most relevant top-sentences, which are critical for preserving the core context, while concurrently applying an open-source text reduction method to condense the sentences that lie between these top-sentences. This step helps in eliminating extraneous information and noise from the text. Moreover, any sentences that appear beyond the last top-sentence are omitted from consideration. This selective approach ensures that only the most contextually relevant information is retained, contributing to a more efficient and focused analysis. Importantly, LeanContext also maintains the original order of both the top-sentences and the other sentences in the text.

- Sampling: A targeted approach was employed to select data for analysis. From the available pool of content, 29 posts and their attached comments were manually selected.
- Inclusion Criteria: Posts were chosen based on their focus on major thematic areas of the COVID-19 infodemic, as identified by WHO report (WHO, 2020).

**Data Analysis:**
- Open Coding: The content of the posts/comments was read multiple times to identify initial themes and categories. In this step data was broken down into discrete parts, closely examined, and compared for similarities and differences.
- Development of Coding Frame: The posts were read individually by the authors, and a coding frame was developed after group discussion sessions.
- Categorization: Posts were reread and recategorized according to the agreed structure.
- Thematic Analysis: The categorized data was then constructed into a higher logical level and, after further discussion, were conceptualized into final themes. This approach identifies, analyzes, and reports patterns (themes) within the data.
- Information Archetype Identification: Based on the themes and categories, the information archetype for each post and its comments was identified.
